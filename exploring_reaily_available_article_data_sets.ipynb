      "’  ’ ”   WASHINGTON, DC  —   As the world adjusts to America’s  uncertainties   about what policies Donald Trump will pursue  —   toward North Korea   in particular  —   remain. ” ’   ”Trying to predict President Trump’’s policy toward Asia, or any   global region for that matter, is difficult if not   impossible,” Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow of   Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”We are in uncharted territory because Trump has not articulated   an Asian policy nor does he even have an identifiable cadre of   Asian advisors,” Klingner added. ’ ’   Echoing that sentiment, David Straub, former State   Department Korea director and associate director of the   Korea Program at Stanford University, told Business   Insider that Trump knows ”next to nothing” about the region. ’ ’   ”He didn’’t say very much about North Korea during the campaign,   and what he did say was incoherent,” Straub told   Business Insider. ’ ”   Notably, while on the campaign trail, Trump said he   would hold a summit with the North’s reckless leader Kim Jong Un   .  ” ’   ”It’’s clear he knows next to nothing about the area and the   problems there, and it will take him and his administration a   long time to get up to speed,” Straub said. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”I can’’t see Trump negotiating a denuclearization agreement with   North Korea,” Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia   Nonproliferation Program at the   Middlebury   Institute of International Studies, told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”And after Libya and what I anticipate will be the collapse of   the agreement with Iran, I don’’t see any appetite in North Korea   either.” ’ ’   Trump also said he would remove US troops from   host nations throughout Asia and Europe if these countries   did not pay their share of the costs. ’ ’   Straub added that Trump should focus on North Korean threats   instead of ”complaining about how much our allies South Korea and   Japan are paying for the upkeep of US forces in their country.” ’ ’   ”The fact is that they already pay a great deal of those costs,   and that it would cost more to move them to the US than keep them   where they are, not to mention the fact that strategic stability   in Northeast Asia is very much in US interests as well as in the   interests of our allies,” Straub said. ’ ”   In regards to China, Pyongyang’s closest ally   and the region’s most powerful nation, Trump   has said he would pressure Chinese president Xi Jinping   to address North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. ” ’   ”Given Trump’’s statements on trade policy with China, it is   difficult to imagine how he can get China to do what he wants,”   Eric Gomez, a policy analyst for defense and foreign policy   studies at the Cato Institute, told Business Insider. ’ ’   ”Despite the instability North Korea causes, Beijing is willing   to keep supporting it so long as it can be a hedge against US   military power in the region. China probably has the best chance   of pressuring North Korea on the nuclear weapons issue, but right   now it’’s difficult to see how Trump would get Beijing to change   its current position,” Gomez added. ’ ’  ’ ’   Similarly, Melik Kaylan,   of ”,” says that Trump will   most likely be unable to adjust Beijing’’s stance. ’ ’   ”China uses North Korea as a lever to distract its regional   rivals,” Kaylan said. ”If Trump is true to his words, he will try   to confront China on a series of issues. China will play the   North Korea card.”  ’ ’   ”Trump will ultimately fall back on the alliances as they   exist,” Kaylan added. ’ ’   Straub notes that Trump may even follow the same policy carried   out by President Obama when dealing with North Korea. ’ ’   ”If Trump is guided by our government experts and institutions,   he will eventually follow roughly the same policy as President   Obama, i. e. ratchet up US and international pressure on North   Korea to give up nuclear weapons each time it commits a   provocation, at the same time bolstering our missile and other   defenses against the North and preparing for all manner of   contingencies,” Straub said. ’ ”   And while the current administration has   slapped Pyongyang with several rounds of   heavy sanctions, the Hermit Kingdom’s brazen rocket   launches and nuclear detonations continue. ” ’   ”This year, Pyongyang successfully conducted two nuclear tests,   an intercontinental ballistic missile test, breakthrough   successes with its     missile and     ballistic missile,   vehicle   technology, a new   rocket engine, and an improved     ICBM engine,” Klingner told Business Insider in   a previous interview. ’ ’  ’ ”   What’s more, during one week in October, the North   launched what are thought to be two Musudan     ballistic missiles  —   one on  and another on .  ” ’   ”This     stuff also suggests that they must have an   inventory of these things that they’’re willing and able to expend   to advance the program,” Thomas Karako, director of the   Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and   International Studies, told Business Insider in a previous   interview. ’ ”   Hours after the aforementioned dual  US Secretary of Defense   Ash Carter met with South Korea’s minister of defense, Han Min   Koo, at the Pentagon. ” ’   ”Make no mistake, any attack on America or our allies will not   only be defeated, but any use of nuclear weapons will be met with   an overwhelming and effective response,” Carter said during the   press conference. ’ ’   ”The United States remains committed to defending our allies   against any threat with the full spectrum of American military   might,” Carter added. ’ ”   Looking to the future, experts agree that Trump’s policies will   not be known for many months after he transitions to the highest   office in the land. ” ’   ”North Korea will of course seek to use that time to its own   advantage, which will not be to ours,” Straub said. ’ ’   ”’’Bewilderment’’ and ’’uncertainty’’ will be the keywords for the   assessing the 2016 presidential election and the path ahead,”   Klingner said. ’\n",

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan  —   A high school parade in Taiwan in which students dressed as Nazi soldiers and carried swastika banners has created a storm of criticism in one of Asia’s most open societies. Hsinchu   High School in Hsinchu City held the parade, which focused on Adolf Hitler, as part of the school’s anniversary celebrations on Friday. The parade also featured cardboard tanks. The students chose the theme, according to local news reports. Photographs of the event spread quickly online, creating a backlash, with the unofficial diplomatic missions of Israel and Germany issuing letters of protest. The episode resulted in the resignation of the school’s principal, Cheng   this week. Mr. Cheng said that he took responsibility, adding that the primary issue was “our education’s problem,” according to local news reports. “It wasn’t necessarily a problem created by the children. ” Taiwanese textbooks, like those in other Asian countries, focus on fighting in Asia during World War II, resulting in lower awareness of events in Europe. In addition to the Israeli and German missions’ responses, the Chabad Taipei Jewish Center also issued a statement expressing regret about “the use of Nazi imagery and logos by students in Taiwan, as it reopens historical wounds suffered by the Jewish people. ” Ross Feingold, chairman of the center, said that many people in Taiwan were unaware that there were more than 1, 000 Jews living among them, many of them   residents with businesses or investments on the island. “Certainly it’s not meant to be an act of ” Mr. Feingold said. “Holocaust education is extremely limited here. ” The parade in Hsinchu is not the first incident in which Nazi references have offended Jews and other groups in Taiwan. In 1999, an advertisement for   DBK space heaters in Taiwan featured a smiling Hitler with the caption, “Declare war on the cold front!” The next year, a restaurant with a concentration camp theme opened, closing weeks after it became a source of outrage. In 2001, the governing Democratic Progressive Party created a television advertisement contrasting Hitler with John F. Kennedy and other leaders, which the party modified after protests from the Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei and others. Officials at the school, which is private but receives subsidies from Taiwan’s Ministry of Education, have said they will show their students movies such as “Schindler’s List” to better educate them on the atrocities of the Holocaust. “A   showing of a movie is not a sustainable program,” Mr. Feingold said. “What is more sustainable is reaching out to the Jewish community that lives here in Taiwan, many of whom have relatives who died in or survived the Holocaust. ”\n",

      "Assuming Senate Democrats cannot torpedo his confirmation, Neil Gorsuch will be a welcome addition to a   Supreme Court often divided over questions of policing, law enforcement, and criminal justice. [The Court’s four liberals —  Justices Ginsberg, Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan too often think of themselves as super legislators rather than judges when they do their opinions reflect their personal proclivities rather than the strict letter of the law. Not so Neil Gorsuch, who prides himself on deciding cases based on the law rather than the outcome he would prefer. In his remarks at the White House, when President Trump nominated him, he said that “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands. ”  Gorsuch may not have been accusing the four SCOTUS liberals of being bad judges —  he is too polite to do that —  but his remarks set him far apart from the ideal liberal judge, who cares little about what the law says, but instead cares a lot about the outcome and its impact on his favorite issues and perceived victims. Liberals’ view of judging was confirmed in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee released this week, when some 100 liberal organizations predictably demanded that Gorsuch not be confirmed because he is not sufficiently sympathetic to “workers’ rights, immigration, women’s health, LGBT rights, police misconduct, students with disabilities, corporate bias, money in politics, environmental protection and voting rights. ” Which is exactly Gorsuch’s point: treat everybody equally under the law, regardless of who they are, and don’t go beyond what the written law provides. A review of opinions Gorsuch as written or joined while on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, together with speeches he has given, indicates that as a Supreme Court justice, he would likely be admired by the law enforcement community. Not because he is “ ” or “  offender,” but because he would be “ . ” In other words, law enforcement will likely approve of his jurisprudence more for what he is not than what he is —  and what he is not is why the liberals don’t think he should be confirmed. That is, he rules predictably, according to the law, rather than trying to favor those the liberals think need an advocate. That is also not to say that he will be a   inalterably strident         justice. His Tenth Circuit opinions include cases where he ruled in favor of police officers, and cases where he ruled against them who, for whatever reason, deserved being ruled against. First, Gorsuch believes that there are far too many laws —  5, 000 or so “with hundreds of new statutory crimes inked every few years,” as he told the Federalist Society in 2013, which, he said “does not begin to count the thousands of additional regulatory crimes buried in the federal register. There are so many crimes cowled in the numbering fine print of those pages that scholars actually debate their number. ” Reform of the criminal code is a job for Congress, not the Court, but intelligent critique from a thoughtful Justice might inspire somebody on the Hill to get started with the project. Gorsuch’s critique of the criminal justice system seems confined to the above point rather than the left’s view that the system is laden with racism and that the police tend to disproportionately arrest minorities, the poor and minor drug offenders, resulting in what liberals refer to as “mass incarceration. ” It is on this point that the left will focus its opposition to his confirmation, among others. In an early critique of his record, for example, People for the American Way wrote that “at a time when the abuses of our criminal justice system are becoming a national crisis, we cannot confirm a justice who does not understand the role of the Supreme Court to protect the most vulnerable among us. ” Gorsuch may be bad news for People for the American Way, but he is good news for law enforcement. Second, Gorsuch has a solid record on    cases, an issue often addressed by the courts he generally, but not always, takes a   enforcement position. In a 2013 case, he sided in the majority in a   split, finding the use of a Taser resulting in the death of an offender was a reasonable use of force under the circumstances. In an earlier case, in 2006, Gorsuch, in a dissent in an en banc civil    case against an officer, in which he was joined by four other judges, asked whether any use of force, no matter how slight, might result in a finding that the force was excessive. But by no means did he always rule on the side of the police —  in at least two other cases, he found the use of force was excessive and that the officers in question were not entitled to qualified immunity. In another   case involving a   kid who kept his class amused by forcing air into his stomach and producing loud burps —  much to the annoyance of his teacher —  Gorsuch dissented from the ruling, finding the police were immune from a civil suit when they arrested and detained him, writing that the teacher went overboard by failing to properly discipline the child and had him arrested by police. A 2012 case is a good indicator of Gorsuch’s strong conviction that criminal laws should not be interpreted in such a way as to jeopardize innocent conduct, just because that conduct can be squeezed between the words of a statute. The case in question involved a felon charged with possessing a gun in violation of a statute which prohibits the “knowing” possession of a firearm by a felon. Gorsuch, in his opinion, reminds us that plenty of minor crimes may technically involve felony convictions even if no jail time is included, so that the convicted defendant may not know he was guilty of a felony. “There can be fewer graver injustices,” wrote Gorsuch, “in a society governed by the rule of law than imprisoning a man without requiring proof of his guilt under the written laws of the land. Yet that is what Capps (the precedent relied on by the prosecutor) permits, excusing the government from proving an essential element of the crime Congress recognized. ” Even if Gorsuch’s narrow reading of the criminal law is sometimes more favorable to the criminal defendant than the prosecutor, those in the criminal justice and law enforcement communities will find his approach a refreshing, and consistent, change from the liberal view that the law should be read more as the judge wishes it had been written, or even by finding some obscure reasoning in the legislative history, or a comment from a member of the legislature that enacted it, giving it a broader interpretation than the written words.\n",

      "LIVERPOOL, England  —   Jackie O’Neill, a    administrative assistant, was explaining the other day why Britain should vote to divorce itself from the European Union in this month’s referendum. As she enumerated her many grievances, I couldn’t help thinking of the scene in Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” in which a bunch of disaffected Judeans sit around, complaining about the Romans. “They’ve bled us white, the bastards,” says their leader, Reg, played by John Cleese. “And what have they ever given us in return?” His colleagues mention a few things, by way of example. O. K. Reg says. “But apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the freshwater system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?” Even Britain’s most enthusiastic European Union supporters would not argue that Europe has been quite so helpful to their country, of course. But as chance would have it, Ms. O’Neill was heaping her abuse on Europe in a spot that has been a particularly enthusiastic recipient of European largess over the years. So when she declared, of the European Union, “We’re subsidizing them, and what do we get out of it except for a load of laws that we don’t vote for?” it was an easy question to answer. For one thing, there was the large building directly behind her, the Echo Arena and BT Convention Center. When the complex was built, in 2008, Europe kicked in 50 million pounds. “Well, I’ve never been to the Echo Arena,” Ms. O’Neill said. Just as many Britons feel emotionally apart and even alien from Europe, so they see the European Union as an opaque, bewildering abstraction, a mysterious bureaucratic behemoth that hoovers up their money and independence while giving little (or nothing) in return. British understanding of its workings and purpose has not been helped by the    arguments being thrown around in the debate over the referendum, set for June 23. No one likes having this debate anyway, much less the unpleasantly       descriptions of its sides: “Brexit” (go) and “Remain” (stay). But underlying all the dire predictions of doom  —   that staying or going will cause Britain to fall apart in various apocalyptic ways  —   is a deeper emotional issue that speaks to the country’s sense of self. Who does it think it is, and where does it think it belongs? Has it ever felt like it’s part of Europe? Separated from the Continent by language, tradition, historic antagonism and an inhospitable body of water, Britain has always seemed to be an uneasy participant in the wider European project. It took years to sign up, and its agreement was always marked by caveats and exceptions to the rules. Even when it did join, it felt to many Britons as if someone had given a British pub owner a bunch of fancy French Champagne bottles and said, “Here, use these for your British ale from now on. ” The trappings might be different, but the beer is still the same. In the 15 years I lived in London (I returned home to the United States three years ago) I was constantly struck by the sense of otherness with which many English people regarded Europeans. (It’s more complicated for Scots, whose mistrust of Britain’s   government makes them more   and for younger people and Londoners, who generally feel part of a wider world.) But travel around England, talking to older people, and you find below the surface a sense of unease, of distrust. Even people who believe that Britain should stay in the European Union, for economic and trading purposes, do not feel very European. At every turn, Britain proclaims its singularity. Most countries fly the European flag next to their national flags Britain doesn’t. Most of Europe uses euros Britain uses pounds. British airports have a passport line that says “British and E. U. Passports. ” British politicians in the last 20 years have increasingly talked about British values and British traditions, about what sets Britons apart from Europeans rather than what they have in common. British people don’t speak the same language as other people in the European Union  —   not literally, not metaphorically. This is a country where one of the main railroad stations, Waterloo, commemorates Napoleon’s defeat by the British, where a serious objection to building the Channel Tunnel was that it might encourage rabid animals to sneak in from France, and where Beauchamp Place in London is pronounced “ . ” The idea that things are easily lost in translation is reflected in the opening line of P. G. Wodehouse’s “The Luck of the Bodkins,” as a Briton confronts the daunting prospect of having to make himself understood on the Continent. “Into the face of the young man who sat on the terrace of the Hotel Magnifique at Cannes,” Wodehouse writes, “there had crept a look of furtive shame, the shifty, hangdog look which announces that an Englishman is about to talk French. ” The   special relationship with the United States isn’t providing much comfort to the Brexit side these days President Obama’s recent admonition to vote no in the referendum enraged many people who believe America should stay out of it and let their country think for itself. As for Europe, some of the British sense of dissonance comes from loss of empire and the country’s complicated feelings about World War II, a moment that showed Britain at its shining best while simultaneously stripping it of its position as a major international power. And some of it stems, simply, from an   sense of otherness. “I might be part of the E. U. but I live on an island,” said Alan Lyon, 49, who shovels cullet  —   broken glass  —   in a glass factory. Mr. Lyon’s    lost both legs in World War I his grandfather fought in World War II. “We couldn’t mention Germany or France around him, he hated them so much,” he said. Britain’s populist tabloids have a long history of slipping happily into   remarks. “Up Yours Delors” read a famous headline in 1990 in The Sun, urging its readers to tell Jacques Delors, then the French head of the European Commission, to “frog off. ” (Mr. Delors supported increased European economic integration, which The Sun did not.) Prince Harry once wore a Nazi commandant costume to a party. And in 2006, officials specifically warned fans traveling to Germany for a soccer match not to do things like shout “Sieg heil” at the referees, or to put their fingers under their noses in a way meant to evoke Hitler’s mustache. Perhaps the favorite television episode here is one on “Fawlty Towers” when a hotel owner, played (again) by Mr. Cleese, responds to a group of German guests by lapsing into xenophobic insanity,   around the dining room and referring to prawn cocktail as “prawn Goebbels. ” (“You started it,” he says when the traumatized customers object. “You invaded Poland. ”) The   side has tapped into   feeling by conflating the European migrant crisis with what many Britons see as a local immigration crisis caused by lax European laws and porous European borders. In their view, the country is being overrun by foreigners who not only take their jobs and welfare benefits, but also bring fundamentally different values into Britain. Recently, Britons were appalled at the news that a German comedian who went on television and recited a rude poem about Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Turkish president, is to be prosecuted under a German law prohibiting the insulting of foreign leaders. As a way to thumb its nose at both Germany and Turkey, the influential   Spectator magazine started a “President Erdogan Offensive Poetry” competition, inviting readers to submit   limericks. The winner was Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and leader of the Brexit campaign, who implied in his poem that Mr. Erdogan was overly fond of goats. Announcing the winner in the magazine, Douglas Murray, who organized the competition, said the existence of the poem (and of Mr. Johnson) showed Britain’s superiority over Germany, which is part of the European Union, and Turkey, which would like to be. “I think it a wonderful thing that a British political leader has shown that Britain will not bow before the putative caliph in Ankara,” he said. “Erdogan may imprison his opponents in Turkey. Chancellor Merkel may imprison Erdogan’s critics in Germany. But in Britain we still live and breathe free. ”\n",

      "LONDON  —   On June 23, tens of thousands of young Britons will be gathered at the Glastonbury music festival, whose headliners include Coldplay, Muse and Adele. Others will be avidly following the European Soccer Championship in France or biting their nails in anticipation of the next episode of hit teenage soap “Hollyoaks. ” Oh, and there is the referendum that day asking them whether Britain should leave the European Union. “Wait, are we even registered to vote?” Priya Patel, 25, asked her friend recently, as they waited outside a theater in east London to see their favorite stars arrive at the British Soap Awards. Would she want Britain to stay in the European Union? “Oh, definitely,” Ms. Patel, a medical practitioner, answered impatiently, switching her attention to her smartphone, visibly more interested in televised dramas than in the   tensions between her country and Brussels. “Wait, what just happened?” she exclaimed as a “Hollyoaks” star rolled by in a car. Holding the attention of young voters  —   and getting them to turn out on June 23  —   is one of the biggest challenges for both sides in the campaign over Britain’s place in Europe, especially for the advocates of remaining in the European Union. Polling suggests that younger people are more favorable to continued British membership in the bloc than are older voters, and in a close race could decide the outcome. The problem for the   forces is that young people are historically less likely to vote. In this case, some analysts say, it could be particularly hard to motivate them, not just because many of them will be immersed in summer activities, but also because they are being asked to embrace the status quo rather than to take up an idealistic cause of change of the type that typically energizes young people. “It’s hard to get them passionate about remaining,” said Scott Townsin, 26, who recently directed a campaign video urging young people to vote in favor of staying in the European Union. Older voters tend to decide based on information they get from traditional media. But with young people, Mr. Townsin said, “you’ve got to be loud, you’ve got to compete with brands, favorite friends, Instagram, whatever, to get their attention. ” Zak Reynolds, 20, from London, said he had yet to make up his mind. One of his parents will vote to stay in, the other to leave. “There’s a lot of propaganda stuff,” he said. Sam Hemphill, 24, an engineering student from Swindon in southwest England, said he had not made up his mind but was leaning toward Britain’s remaining. Part of his uncertainty, he said, was driven by the perception that the campaigns “are both lying. ” “All the facts and figures feel manipulated, which makes the decision hard,” he said. “They are both polar opposites appealing on emotions rather than facts. ” The In campaign used targeted Facebook ads to imply (falsely) that a British exit, or Brexit, could stop British soccer clubs from signing European players. (“If we leave the E. U. how will Tottenham be affected?” one ad asked.) The Out campaign lent its support to a pop concert in Birmingham, only to have three acts pull out because they did not agree with its   position. The voter registration deadline was Thursday, prompting ambitious drives by both sides to sign up supporters. Groups like Bite the Ballot, an organization that tries to encourage youths to vote, teamed up with Starbucks, which favors Britain’s remaining in the European Union, to hold registration drives in coffee shops across the country. Uber, which has not taken a position on the referendum, flashed ads on customers’ smartphones reminding them to register. Some surveys indicate that half of those between ages 18 and 30 want to remain in Europe, with the proportion higher among those under 25. Young Britons are generally comfortable with a multicultural society, surveys have found, and they value the opportunity to work and travel in 28 European nations without a visa. A survey released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of those 18 to 34 years old in Britain had a favorable view of the European Union, compared with 38 percent of people 50 and over. The 180, 000 or so people attending the   festival in Glastonbury will have to vote by mail  —   a relatively tedious process  —   or apply to have someone else vote on their behalf. (There will be no polling booths on the festival grounds, 900 acres of farmland in Somerset, since people have to vote where they are registered.) The same voting rules apply to the 300, 000 to 500, 000 British fans, many of them under 30, who the police expect will travel to France for the monthlong European Soccer Championship. Some of the efforts to get young people to vote are paying off. Since March 1, more than a million people have registered to vote, with big gains among those 18 to 34 years old, according to figures published recently by the government. Ashleigh Breedy, a    florist in favor of Brexit, said the referendum was so important that she would vote for the very first time. “All that money we’re sending to Belgium and them telling us what to do,” she said, referring to Brussels, where the European Commission is based. “Our queen doesn’t have a say,” she said. “Is Belgium going to tell our queen what to do?” she asked, puffing on a cigarette and drinking a can of Red Bull. “If enough of us stand up to leave, we’ll leave. ” Brexit campaigners are calling for more controls on immigration and greater national sovereignty the option of remaining is appealing to voters because of the economic benefits. Charlie Carline, 31, a British exit supporter who will be in France on referendum day, said he had made sure to vote by mail. It is “very important,” he wrote in a message on Facebook. “I want out of the European Union dictatorship. Look at the state of Europe because of these   scum leaders. ” By contrast, some of the young people supporting Britain’s continued membership in the European Union are less passionate. For them, the monthslong campaign often felt more like   Conservative politicians arguing over a dining bill. “It’s hard not to get bored by it,” said Josh Glancy, 29, who plans to go to Glastonbury and who applied for a postal vote only because a friend had insisted. “It’s a kind of spat among the Tory party, so I’ve become quite fed up with it. ” Still, he said he planned to vote to stay in Europe because he liked “the idea of a Europe that can cooperate” over issues including the migrant crisis. Vahan Salorian, 23, who juggles work as a composer, primary school music teacher and pub supervisor, said he would vote for Britain to remain in Europe. “I’ve been watching with mild terror” the possibility of a British exit, he said, wearing a   decorated with avocados and sipping beer with friends in a park in east London. “I’m terrified it might happen. ” Mr. Salorian, who is from the rural town of Barnoldswick in northern England, said living in a cosmopolitan city like London shaped his views. Friends in Barnoldswick, he said, were planning to vote out even though the area has had very little immigration. Back in east London at the British Soap Awards, Jennifer Burnett, 33, said she was registered to vote, but was unsure about her intentions. She had more definite views about the soaps. “I know exactly who I’m going to vote for,” she said. “Vote ‘Hollyoaks’!” she exclaimed, raising a plastic champagne cup in a celebratory gesture.\n",

      "LONDON  —   David Cameron, the British prime minister, has no one to blame but himself. In 2013, besieged by the increasingly assertive   Union wing of his own Conservative Party, Mr. Cameron made a promise intended to keep a   peace among the Tories before the 2015 general election: If   he would hold an    referendum on continued British membership in the bloc. But what seemed then like a relatively   ploy to deal with a   political problem has metastasized into an issue that could badly damage Britain’s economy, influence the country’s direction for generations  —   and determine Mr. Cameron’s political fate. As the nation prepares to vote on Thursday, the betting markets are signaling that Britain will choose to remain in Europe, but polls suggest that the outcome is still too close to call. On Tuesday, speaking in front of No. 10 Downing Street, Mr. Cameron warned that a decision to leave would be an “irreversible” choice. Appealing to older voters, many of whom tend to favor leaving Europe, Mr. Cameron urged them to think about what they would bequeath to the next generation. “Above all it is about our economy,” he said. The bluff, ruddy Mr. Cameron is famously lucky, having pulled out   victories in numerous other scrapes. But in this case, many analysts say, he will be damaged goods even if he wins, with rivals circling to succeed him and Conservatives more divided than ever. If he loses, he will come under pressure to resign, and even if he hangs on for some portion of the four years left in his government’s term, whatever substantive legacy he might have built will be lost to what many consider to be a wholly unnecessary roll of the dice. Martin Wolf, the economic columnist of The Financial Times, wrote that “this referendum is, arguably, the most irresponsible act by a British government in my lifetime. ” Summarizing the nearly unanimous opinion of economists that a British exit  —   “Brexit”  —   would be followed by a major shock and permanent loss of growth, he concluded: “The outcome might well prove devastating. ” Mr. Cameron argues that the referendum had to be called to resolve the festering debate over Britain and the European Union. As in the Scottish referendum on independence in 2014, he says, this vote represents a “great festival of democracy” on a very difficult and divisive topic. But if the Scottish referendum turned nasty, and kept the United Kingdom together, this one has become poisonous, with Mr. Cameron’s own cabinet colleagues and supposed friends saying that he has eroded trust in politics, portraying him as a liar and acting like a government in waiting. It has been a campaign punctuated by numerous claims that have little relationship to the facts, with sharp tones of xenophobia, racism, nativism and Islamophobia. And it was marked tragically last Thursday by the assassination of a young Labour member of Parliament, Jo Cox, who fiercely supported remaining in the union. On Tuesday evening, some of that bitterness surfaced in a fiery television debate in which London’s new mayor, Sadiq Khan, who wants Britain to remain in the bloc, said that the campaign of his opponents “hasn’t been project fear, it’s been project hate as far as immigration is concerned. ” Steven Fielding, a professor of political history at the University of Nottingham, said that Mr. Cameron “has made the case against himself, and he’s damaged either way. ” The prime minister presumably thought it would be an easy win for the “Remain” forces, Mr. Fielding added. “But it’s far tighter than anyone thought,” he said, “and rather than a salve on the Tory party, it’s made the fever worse. ” Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary University of London, is slightly less harsh. “It’s really a binary legacy” for Mr. Cameron, he said. “It is either one that ends in almost complete failure or one that seems pretty respectable in electoral and policy terms. I can’t think of another prime minister who had so much riding on one decision. ” If the Remain campaign loses, “the chances of him staying on are pretty remote,” Professor Bale said. “He will go down as the person who miscalculated, taking us out of Europe almost by mistake, and then shuffled off the stage” in “a pretty ignominious exit. ” Even if Britain votes to stay in the bloc, Mr. Bale said, given Mr. Cameron’s small parliamentary majority, “the number of   euroskeptics and   he’ll be subject to defeats and blackmail until he steps down. ” There are those who support the contention that Mr. Cameron had to call this referendum in the face of Tory division and the rise of the U. K. Independence Party and its leader, Nigel Farage. UKIP was cutting into the Conservative vote by arguing, as the “Leave” campaign does now, that Britain could limit immigration and control its own borders only by leaving the European Union. Mr. Cameron, who had repeatedly pledged to get immigration down to the “tens of thousands”  —   even though last year net migration was some 330, 000 people  —   never had a persuasive answer to the immigration question. To pacify the growing number of   Union Tories, keep his leadership position and undermine UKIP, he promised this referendum if he won the 2015 election, which he did by a larger margin than expected. Even before the election, some, like Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House and a supporter of the Remain movement, argued that a referendum would come at some point, and that it would be more easily won under Mr. Cameron and the Tories. Charles Lewington, a former director of communications for the Conservative Party, said there had to be a referendum. By 2013, he said, “there was tremendous pressure for an   referendum and not just from the old guard. ” Mr. Lewington cited growing concern from Conservative members of Parliament that they were at risk of losing their seats in districts where UKIP was strong. Given the panic in the party, he said, “I don’t think he could have avoided making an   manifesto commitment. ” But Tony Travers, a professor of government at the London School of Economics, is less sure. “Cameron didn’t need to do it,” Professor Travers said. Like Harold Wilson, the Labour prime minister who organized a referendum on Europe in 1975, Mr. Cameron began the referendum as an exercise in “internal party discipline,” he said. It was called “for party reasons more than national ones,” he added. Nicholas Soames, Winston Churchill’s grandson, a friend of Mr. Cameron’s and a Tory legislator, was more scathing about the failure of several Conservative leaders to confront, rather than appease, the   Tory euroskeptics. “If you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,” Mr. Soames said in an interview with the British website Conservativehome. “You can pat it on the head, in which case it’ll bite you, or you can kick it really hard. ” “Successive prime ministers, and it’s not the present prime minister alone, have never understood that they have to take these people on,” Mr. Soames said. If the Remain side loses, both Mr. Cameron and his deputy, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, are likely to be gone within months, Mr. Lewington said. While all denying any ambition to replace Mr. Cameron, the sharks are in the water, led by Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and a prominent campaigner for leaving the European Union. But the winner of such contests in the Tory party is rarely the one who wields the knife, and while Mr. Johnson would seem to lead the race, his success is far from assured.\n",

      "AYRSHIRE, Scotland  —   His campaign is desperately short of cash. He has struggled to hire staff. Influential Republicans are demanding that he demonstrate that he can run a serious general election campaign. But for reasons that emphasize just how unusual a candidate he is, Donald J. Trump was to leave the campaign trail on Thursday to travel to Scotland to promote a golf course his company purchased on the country’s southwestern coast. Normally when presidential contenders travel abroad, they do so to burnish their foreign policy credentials, cramming their schedules with   meetings with foreign dignitaries and opining on the pressing international issues of the day. But, to a large extent, Mr. Trump’s business interests still drive his behavior and his schedule. He has planned two days in Scotland, with no meetings with government or political leaders scheduled. And despite the fact that Mr. Trump was to touch down in Britain the day after its “Brexit” vote on whether to leave the European Union, his itinerary  —   a helicopter landing at his luxury resort, a ceremonial ribbon cutting and family photograph, and a news conference  —   reads like a   junket crossed with a golf vacation. “Traditionally, nominees travel overseas during this period to brush up their foreign policy depth and visit 10 Downing Street and Israel  —   for politics back here,” said Scott W. Reed, senior political strategist for the U. S. Chamber of Commerce. “Everyone knows this is the wrong thing for the nominee to be doing now, and it is amazing this can’t be stopped. ” Mr. Trump will arrive Friday at Trump Turnberry, a luxury golf course and resort dating to the 1900s that he bought in 2014. The property features picturesque views of the Irish Sea and suites costing as much as 800 pounds  —   roughly $1, 200  —   a night. He has told aides that he hopes the trip, which includes a stop in Aberdeen on Saturday, will provide a   reset for his campaign. But some of the aides have said privately that they wished he would cancel it. Mr. Trump’s   as a successful businessman is important to him, and, though he has said publicly that he is relying more on his children to run the Trump Organization, he remains closely tied to it. He also believes that many of his supporters are drawn to his persona of a brash billionaire, born out of his decades in the business world. He does not like to be away from his business operations for long. Save for a little more than a dozen nights during the primaries, he has returned to one of his homes at the end of each day. He usually returns to his New York City apartment, which allows him access to his   office in Trump Tower, where he works and takes part in interviews. And he tends to rely on   businesses while he is campaigning, further bringing together the two worlds in which he operates. Perhaps the starkest example of his business empire’s intruding on his political career came late last month. Mr. Trump delivered scathing criticism of Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel  —   first at a San Diego rally and then in interviews  —   that was less a result of a politically strategic calculation than of Mr. Trump’s concerns about rulings the judge made in a federal lawsuit against his now defunct Trump University. Mr. Trump accused the   judge of being unable to render fair rulings because of his “Mexican heritage. ’’ The political backlash was swift, with many of Mr. Trump’s supporters distancing themselves from him and calling his comments racist. The Scotland trip, too, is potentially fraught. Since clinching the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump has squandered numerous opportunities to unify the Republican Party behind him, or to exhibit the discipline party leaders and donors are eager to see. When Barack Obama headed to Europe as a presidential candidate in 2008, and Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, traveled to England, Israel and Poland during his campaign, they sought to demonstrate their global savvy and stature, in meticulously planned visits. (Mr. Romney’s trip, nonetheless, was a   disaster, and many of his aides later said they wished he had stayed home.) “Foreign trips are an inherently risky endeavor,” said Lanhee Chen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution who advised Mr. Romney in 2012. “Ideally, they will boost a candidate’s credibility on and familiarity with the geopolitical issues of the region they visit. But they require a lot of planning and logistical coordination. Seems to me that a foreign trip driven solely by personal financial interests  —   as Trump seems to be planning later this week  —   would be unprecedented. ” Showing up right after the Brexit vote, in the middle of a tumultuous time, is leaving Mr. Trump especially vulnerable to criticism, as well as creating the potential for an international blunder. When asked about the vote in an interview this month with The Hollywood Reporter, Mr. Trump seemed not to be familiar with Britain’s referendum, first answering, “Huh?” and then, “Hmm. ” Finally, after the Brexit vote was explained to him, Mr. Trump answered with his trademark decisiveness: “Oh yeah, I think they should leave,” he said, a sentiment he has since repeated. On Wednesday morning, however, Mr. Trump told Fox Business that his opinion on the issue was not significant because he had not followed it closely. But business has always been inextricably bound with politics for Mr. Trump, dating to his previous flirtations with presidential bids, which served largely to elevate his public profile and business interests. The latest documents submitted to the Federal Election Commission, for instance, show that Mr. Trump paid at least $1. 1 million in May to his business and family members for   expenses. The largest payment, for $423, 000, went to his    Club, for the use of that private Florida resort, but he also reimbursed costs associated with his private airplanes, Trump restaurants, and even Trump Tower, which houses his campaign headquarters. “Why would I use someone else’s properties?” Mr. Trump said through Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, in response to a question about why he had hosted campaign events at his properties. “Mr. Trump owns some of the finest properties anywhere in the world and he has to host events, news conferences, etc. which might as well be hosted at those properties,” Ms. Hicks added in an email. “They are paid, in accordance with F. E. C. regulations, their approximate fair market value for goods and services. ” Mr. Trump also sometimes reserves the front rows at his news conferences for members of his private clubs, almost as a membership perk. And at a primary election event in March at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Trump was flanked by bottles (and cases) of   wine,   water, and a mound of raw steaks, which he tried to pass off as his brand. Even Mr. Trump’s private 757, emblazoned with his name across the side and a tool for his businesses, now occupies a central role in his campaign imagery, rolling up to airport hangars during primary rallies as a symbol of power and success. People in the crowd gawk, pointing to the plane, unprompted, as a reason they believe in Mr. Trump. Yet some Republicans still think Mr. Trump should simply disentangle the personal (and business) from the political. Mr. Chen, for instance, had a suggestion for Mr. Trump’s trip. “If he’s going to Europe anyway,” he asked, “why not take some time to visit with the NATO allies that would be affected by his plan to pull back on the U. S. commitment to the organization?”\n",

      "LONDON  —   President Obama has called on the British people not to vote for an exit from the European Union, writing in an opinion article published upon his arrival in London late Thursday night that “the European Union doesn’t moderate British influence  —   it magnifies it. ” In the article in The Telegraph, Mr. Obama, making a case he has made numerous times before in Washington, wrote that the United States would prefer Britain to remain a full member of the European Union. Britons will vote on June 23 in a referendum on whether to remain in or leave the bloc. The last such referendum was in 1975, and Britons voted by nearly two to one to stay. But the vote is expected to be closer in June, and some prominent British advocates of quitting the European Union have criticized Mr. Obama’s intervention. London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, one of the public leaders of the campaign for Britain’s exit, has accused Mr. Obama of hypocrisy because the United States does not share sovereignty with its neighbors the way Britain now does with the European Union. In the article, Mr. Obama responded directly to that criticism, asserting that the challenges facing Europe are not different from the ones facing the United States. “And in today’s world, even as we all cherish our sovereignty, the nations who wield their influence most effectively are the nations that do it through the collective action that today’s challenges demand,” the president wrote. Mr. Obama starts the first of four days in Europe on Friday by paying homage to one of its most enduring institutions, making his first visit to Windsor Castle to attend a royal lunch with Queen Elizabeth II a day after her 90th birthday. But he arrives with a grim warning that he will deliver in a series of meetings with several political leaders: Europe is in danger of being pulled apart by threats to its security and economy that can be overcome only by greater cooperation and a unity that appears increasingly elusive. In the article, Mr. Obama praised the creation of what he called “international institutions and initiatives” to promote peace and democracy, including the European Union and NATO. “Today, we face tests to this order  —   terrorism and aggression migration and economic headwinds  —   challenges that can only be met if the United States and the United Kingdom can rely on one another, on our special relationship, and on the partnerships that lead to progress,” Mr. Obama wrote. Terrorist attacks like the ones in Brussels and Paris have exposed shortcomings in the gathering and sharing of intelligence that have left Europe vulnerable and scared. War in Syria, where the most recent   appears to be failing, has produced a flood of migrants that is causing political and economic turmoil in Europe. The   aggression in Ukraine has raised new questions about the effectiveness of the NATO alliance. And the vote in June threatens to cleave Britain from the European Union, potentially stalling one of the world’s most successful economic powerhouses. “Because of a host of issues  —   from migration to sluggish economic growth to the terrorist threat  —   the European Union today faces challenges from populism and other threats to its ” said Charles Kupchan, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama for European issues. “The E. U. is one of the great accomplishments of the   War II era. It has succeeded in helping remove war from Europe, and we are concerned about the health and vitality of that experiment. ” Mr. Obama traveled to Britain after a series of meetings in Saudi Arabia, where he said Thursday that the United States would continue to enhance security cooperation with its allies in the Persian Gulf, while encouraging them to carry out domestic reforms and bolster their ability to defend themselves. During those meetings, he discussed a variety of issues with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council  —   Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait and Oman  —   including the civil wars in Yemen, Syria and Libya, military and economic cooperation, and the fight against terrorist groups like the Islamic State. But Mr. Obama left without announcing any concrete plans or initiatives on any of those matters. In a meeting planned for Friday afternoon with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, Mr. Obama will urge his counterpart to increase intelligence sharing and cooperation among European countries so that they can better counter terrorist threats, including attacks by the Islamic State and Al Qaeda, aides to the president said. On Sunday, Mr. Obama will discuss the Syrian migration crisis with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Benjamin J. Rhodes, the president’s deputy national security adviser, said Mr. Obama would applaud Ms. Merkel for her efforts to absorb Syrian refugees, even at great political cost. And he will pledge United States support for the recent deal that the European Union made with Turkey to accept Syrian migrants. Then on Monday, the president will meet with the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Italy. Among the messages for the group will be his contention that they must take more responsibility for their own security. That will be a familiar refrain to Mr. Obama’s colleagues, who will recall that he made a similar  —   if more blunt  —   observation in a recent article in The Atlantic in which he accused some European allies of being “free riders” who rely on help from the United States instead of investing in their own militaries. “There’s this greater sense of unraveling, if you will, of the European project,” said Heather Conley, a former State Department official and the senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. That concern is likely to be set aside during Mr. Obama’s visit with the queen, and during his dinner on Friday night with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace.\n",

      "PARIS  —   The rest of the European Union nations are looking at the possibility of a British departure from the bloc with disbelief, trepidation and anguish. But they are also preparing to retaliate. If Britons do vote in a referendum on Thursday to leave the European Union, they can expect a tough and unforgiving response, with capitals across the Continent intent on deterring other countries from following the British example, European officials and analysts said. In other words, Britain will be made to suffer for its choice. With other issues pressing, including Greek debt, the migrant crisis and terrorism, the largest and most powerful European nations will want clarity, and are not likely to tolerate a long period of   confusion. “In is in  —   out is out,” the powerful German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told Spiegel magazine. “I hope and believe that the British will ultimately decide against Brexit. The withdrawal of Britain would be a heavy loss for Europe. ” The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, spoke apocalyptically about a British exit, or “Brexit,” to the German tabloid Bild. He said all members of the European Union would suffer, as would the postwar structure of Europe that had kept the peace. “Why is it so dangerous?” Mr. Tusk asked. “No one can foresee what the   consequences would be. As a historian, I fear that Brexit could be the beginning of the destruction of not only the E. U. but also of Western political civilization. ” Britain would face at least seven years of limbo during painful negotiations about a new relationship with the bloc, Mr. Tusk said. Preparing for a British vote to withdraw, France and Germany are debating the immediate announcement of a joint initiative on European security, perhaps an operational command headquarters, to show, at least symbolically, that the European Union remains solid and will continue to progress without Britain. But Germany has rejected some ideas from the European Commission, the permanent bureaucracy in Brussels, to respond by moving quickly toward more European political or fiscal integration, understanding that with Spanish elections this month and French and German elections next year, “more Europe” is not what voters want. And no government wants treaty change, which would prompt more referendums at a time when populist,   sentiments are running strong across the Continent. Suggestions by British politicians favoring a departure that the rest of the European Union will give Britain more favorable terms in a new trading arrangement will be rejected out of hand by European leaders, who do not want to make further concessions to a country that has rejected them, officials said. This would ensure that the British example discouraged others tempted to seek a special deal for themselves. To that end, the main European Union nations are envisioning a   negotiating process for a British exit, once the British government invokes Article 50 of the treaty governing membership in the bloc. Article 50 provides two years to haggle over the terms of a divorce from the bloc  —   something that has never happened. The European Union is expected to want to talk about a future trade agreement only after Britain and the other 27 nations in the bloc have made a decision about how to unwind British membership. That process would require resolving complex legal and financial issues and addressing all kinds of topics that would affect ordinary people  —   what happens to pensions and health coverage, as well as the immigration status of European citizens working and living in Britain, and that of British citizens in the bloc. Officials want to negotiate future trade and financial services arrangements with Britain as a nonmember they do not want to allow Britain to use the status of European citizens in Britain and their rights as a bargaining chip in the trade negotiations, which could take several years to conclude, beyond the   time limit for exit talks. Even then, Brussels would offer Britain one of the three existing models of varying closeness and mutual obligation  —   the bloc’s arrangements with Norway, Canada and the World Trade Organization  —   rather than offer to negotiate something new, said Charles Grant, the director of the Center for European Reform, a London research institution. France and Belgium, and probably Germany, are almost certain to reject any British proposal to remain within the European single market  —   even, or especially, for financial services  —   without at least an agreement that Britain continue to allow European citizens to live and work in Britain, analysts and officials said. In any case, such a   the   Norway model, is strongly opposed by British advocates of withdrawing from the bloc, in the name of controlling immigration. “There is no appetite to be nice on the day after,” said Camille Grand, the director of the Foundation for Strategic Research in France. “Whatever the British say or feel, there will be a price to pay, if only to prevent further attempts to exit the E. U. ” The French message, Mr. Grand said, is like Mr. Schäuble’s: “If you leave, you leave. And we won’t grant you the benefits of the single market. You won’t move to an à la carte membership. ” The Germans and the Dutch, Mr. Grand said, “might be tempted to be more flexible, but in Paris, it’s a divorce, and we must be tough with the British to prevent the Czechs or whomever from trying to make their own deals. ” But it may be the political aspect of a British exit that worries Europeans the most, coupled with the expected financial shock, said Guntram Wolff, the director of Bruegel, an independent research institution in Brussels. “Populists throughout Europe will celebrate this as a ‘feast of democracy,’ where finally the citizens get their say over the elites,” Mr. Wolff said. “Populists all over Europe will gain in strength. And markets could react by saying, ‘The first brick is out of the wall, and now let’s bet on another brick. ’” The next brick, Mr. Wolff said, could be economically troubled Italy, and that “could set in motion a domino effect,” with the euro dropping sharply in value along with the pound. So the European Central Bank would have to be prepared to prop up the banks and the euro against market pressure, just as the Bank of England would have to prop up the pound. No one in Germany thinks it would be good if the British left, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the Europe program at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “If the European Union is not able to prove that membership is worth having, and that in the end emotion wins over rational debates, this not only tells you something about public sentiment in Britain, but will have a contagion effect in other nations,” she said. Added to European instability, Ms. Schwarzer said, the immediate economic shock could badly damage countries with high debt, like France, Italy and Greece. Even if the British vote to remain, “this Europe of multiple speeds may continue to disintegrate,” said Emmanuel Macron, France’s economy minister. “But if the U. K. leaves, we will have this risk squared. Are we capable of keeping the founding promises that led to the union’s creation  —   peace, prosperity, freedom?” The effect on the bloc of a British departure would be threefold, Mr. Grant said. First, he said, a British withdrawal would be a big boost to nationalist,   Union movements, with Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s   National Front, already comparing a British exit to the fall of the Berlin Wall. “It’s not that the right will win power, but they’ll feel they have history with them, and   elites in government will be on the back foot and afraid of moves toward more integration,” Mr. Grant said. “Federalism would be dead, and there would be no more referendums and treaty changes for generations, so it would be a new period of national power and not the federal future the European Commission wants. ” Second, he said, without the counterweight of Britain, “the German problem becomes more acute. ” Rome, Paris and Warsaw fear that without Britain as a countervailing force in the bloc, Germany would become too powerful. The Germans themselves fear that an   alliance would form. Third, he said, the European Union without Britain’s   influence would be more French in its economic policy outlook and more protectionist, with little impetus for   deals or for the extension of the single market to services. “The stakes are high, because what happens in Britain will set off a domino effect and possibly a cycle of disintegration,” said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. “The European Union would look like a broken project, a declining power. ” Radoslaw Sikorski, a former Polish foreign minister, said a British departure from the bloc might have some benefits for those who want the nations of Europe to continue drawing closer. “Europe could forge ahead with a common security policy, which the British have vetoed repeatedly,” he said. “And the countries of the eurozone would probably insist on all euro trade being moved out of Britain,” which could help efforts by Paris, Frankfurt and Luxembourg to establish themselves as more important financial centers relative to London. But over all, Mr. Sikorski said, “the European Union is much better with Britain in it, providing liberal politics, liberal economics and a center of democratic political consensus of a kind needed now in Europe. ”\n",

      "LONDON  —   Members of the Driscoll family tend not to fight. If they do, it’s over whose turn it is to vacuum. Leslie Driscoll, 55, sells hot cross buns in an English bakery in London and addresses her customers with “love” or “darling” her husband, Peter, 54, works as a floor layer their daughter, Louise, a    with dyed blue hair, is a barista in a hip coffee shop. But last week, the Driscolls fell out. Badly. They had an argument so big they did not speak to one another for days, Ms. Driscoll said. Shortly afterward, her husband went off in a huff to see friends up north, in Derby. The source of the family drama: whether Britain should exit the European Union, a process often referred to as “Brexit. ” With only days to go until the referendum on membership in the bloc on Thursday, polls suggest that the country is deeply split along socioeconomic and regional lines, with many older and   voters in England favoring leaving, and younger and   Britons, and a majority of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland, favoring staying. As the consequences of the choice come into focus for voters, tensions are bubbling. In the case of the Driscoll family, they are boiling over. “I completely disagree with her,” Louise said on a recent afternoon, looking her mother squarely in the face as they sat in a cafe. “We shouldn’t be leaving, like, an organization that has helped us more than we could ever help ourselves if we were to go it alone. ” Louise is the only one in her family who wants Britain to remain. Her parents and her    grandfather want out. “This is a little island,” her mother said    lighting up a cigarette and letting the ash fall on her glittery sneakers. “We should look after our own first. Charity begins at home. ” “But we are all people!” Louise said. “We should help each other. ” “It don’t work that way, darling,” her mother replied, shaking her head. “If you’re born here, you pass as English. I don’t care whether you’re black, white, green or blue, or purple with pink spots on  —   you’re English. ” Those born abroad, Ms. Driscoll said, “have got their own governments, their own parliaments, whatever. ” Up and down the country, the debate is pitting husband against wife, children against parents, sisters against brothers. The divisions are unlikely to heal easily after the referendum is decided. Even the family of Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London and the most prominent face of the campaign for leaving the bloc, has not been immune to disputes: His father, Stanley sister, Rachel and brother Jo, who is a member of Parliament and who worked closely with Prime Minister David Cameron, favor remaining in the union. Boris Johnson’s mother, Charlotte Johnson Wahl, wants to leave. (Rachel Johnson reportedly tried, without success, to dissuade the former mayor from backing a British exit over a soggy game of tennis.) In Islington, the neighborhood in London where members of the Driscoll family have lived for eight generations, residents are increasingly going public with their voting intentions, which is a rarity in Britain. Rows of houses on some streets have “Remain” posters in their windows. On a thoroughfare filled with butchers, bakeries and     tradespeople nodded their head vigorously when asked if they were planning to vote out. The clash over Britain’s continued membership in Europe has touched on issues as varied as immigration, terrorism, the economy, London’s housing shortage and the fate of the National Health Service. Some of these issues, like immigration, are directly related to the European Union. Others, like the shortage of affordable housing, have little to do with it. Yet those distinctions are blurring. For many, the referendum is as much a chance to register displeasure with the country’s direction as it is an opportunity to reject or embrace Europe. The stance of some voters is being shaped by personal experience and anecdote. There is, for example, a widespread perception that European citizens are flocking to Britain, especially from Eastern Europe, to take advantage of its social welfare system. But Britain’s welfare system is not as generous as those of many other European nations, and fewer than 7 percent of immigrants receive benefits. In Ms. Driscoll’s case, she remembers her grandfather pawning and   his suit to get by. That memory was revived, she said, with the discovery a few years ago that a newly arrived Polish family in her neighborhood had received money to buy a car and move into a   house. “Years ago, we never had social security or anything like that,” Ms. Driscoll said. “You sold your own. ” Her grandmother would get her “granddad’s suit out of pawn when he got paid on Friday, put it back in pawn on Monday,” Ms. Driscoll said. “That’s how they lived. ” Having different cultures and communities is “fantastic,” she said, “but what I don’t like is the fact that, through having that, we’ve now left ourselves open. I feel like a   citizen in my own country. ” Ms. Driscoll is proudly English (not, in her mind, British  —   she crossed out the word on her passport and replaced it with “English”). Her father fought in World War II, and her grandfather in World War I. She has lived all her life in this area of London. Louise grew up in the same area but in a more prosperous, multicultural Britain than earlier generations had experienced. In school, she was one of only two white students. Her friends are Eritrean, Nigerian and South African. Louise voted for the Green Party in last year’s general election and was appalled that her mother, traditionally a Labour voter, had opted for the     U. K. Independence Party. (“Sorry, I know I’m a bit antiquated  —   can’t help it, love,” Ms. Driscoll replied, somewhat sheepishly, after Louise uttered an expletive.) Louise said she understood the pressures that immigration placed on schools and hospitals. But leaving the European Union worried her, she said, because it risked wrecking the economy and making it hard for young people to secure employment. It took her eight months to find work as a barista, she said. “If I wanted to work abroad, it would be a lot easier if England was in the E. U.,” Louise said. Her mother suggested that Louise move to New York, possibly unaware of the paradox that this would make her an immigrant herself. Almost inevitably, the debate over immigration veered into an argument about terrorism. Britain’s porous borders were letting terrorists slip through, Ms. Driscoll said, repeating a message the camp to leave the European Union has relentlessly pushed on voters. Louise asked why she wanted to shut immigrants out of England. “It ain’t the nice ones I’m worried about,” her mother replied. “It’s the nasty ones. ” “To have opened the floodgates, it’s like saying, ‘Come, and come and kill us,’ ” she said, adding that members of the Irish Republican Army had at least notified the public before setting off bombs across Britain during the 1970s and 1980s. “We can get on a bus tomorrow with a bloke with a backpack, and   boom,” Ms. Driscoll said. “Yeah? Nothing to do with what they call their beliefs. ” Louise rolled her eyes. In what sounded like a final plea, she said: “At the end of the day, the E. U. is going to affect my generation more than it will affect your generation. So shouldn’t it be down to us to decide whether or not to stay?” Her mother fell silent and was thoughtful. “I am 55 years of age,” she said slowly. “I know  —   I appreciate that in 50 years’ time, you’ll be here and I won’t, and you’ll have to put up with whatever’s happened. ” She paused. “But I still want out,” she said. “Sorry. ”\n",

      "LONDON  —   Supporters of a British exit from the European Union opened up a substantial lead over advocates of staying in the bloc as the nation tallied the votes early Friday on one of its most momentous decisions in generations. With more than half of towns and cities reporting, the   Leave campaign was leading by more than 700, 000 votes out of more than 24 million that had been counted, an advantage of 51. 6 percent to 48. 4 percent over the Remain campaign, according to the BBC. “Dare to dream that the dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom,” Nigel Farage, the leader of the U. K. Independence Party, one of the primary forces behind the push for a referendum on leaving the European Union, told cheering supporters just after 4 a. m. denouncing the “lies, corruption and deceit” that he said elites in both major parties  —   Conservative and Labour  —   had peddled. The vote was still too close to call, and Remain supporters were not giving up. But as Thursday night turned to Friday morning, the results were consistently giving hope to the Leave campaign while inducing deep worry among supporters of staying in Europe, starting with Prime Minister David Cameron. The early results startled the financial markets, which gyrated wildly after initially banking on a victory for the Remain campaign. At one point the value of the pound plummeted to $1. 36 from $1. 50, the sharpest   drop on record. Officials were busily counting some 33. 6 million ballots cast Thursday by an estimated 72 percent of eligible voters at the conclusion of a campaign that amounted to a fierce debate over sovereignty, national identity, immigration and trade. The Leave campaign did better than anticipated in areas it had expected to win, particularly in northeast England, and picked up Swansea, a Welsh city it had not expected to win. The Remain campaign performed well in the inner London boroughs of Wandsworth, Lambeth, Hammersmith and Fulham, but it barely carried Newcastle upon Tyne, a university town it had expected to dominate. Proponents of staying in the European Union started the night in a confident mood, especially after Mr. Farage suggested that he was not optimistic about victory. The first indication that the outcome might be closer than some of the late polling suggested came from one of the first sizable areas to report, as the Leave campaign did even better than expected in Sunderland, a   community in the northeast. Voting lasted from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. though some particularly crowded poll sites stayed open longer to accommodate voters still in line to cast their ballots. Two other   opinion surveys also gave the Remain camp an edge, but given the failure of most British pollsters to foresee the Conservative Party’s victory in last year’s general elections, many analysts were putting little trust in surveys. “Neither a comfortable Remain victory nor a comfortable Leave victory can be ruled out,” Stephen Fisher, an elections expert who teaches at Oxford, wrote on Thursday morning, after noting that polling averages gave Remain a very slight lead. About half of voters were thought to have walked to the polls, though many others drove and a few even rode horses. Strong rains in parts of the capital and southeast England complicated voting floods forced the borough of Kingston upon Thames in southwest London to move two polling sites. By the Thursday evening rush, rains had caused delays on several subway lines and brought foot traffic at Waterloo, the capital’s busiest train station, to a standstill. Many Britons posted photos of themselves accompanied by their dogs and cats, prompting internet memes. Until the polls closed, news organizations were  prohibited from reporting accounts of how people voted, but in interviews, Britons expressed their concerns and anxieties in more general terms. In the deprived town of Oldham, near Manchester, a traditional stronghold of the Labour Party, Lisa Kirk, 43, said she and her family had been swayed by the U. K. Independence Party, which opposes Britain’s membership in the European Union, and expressed disenchantment with British leaders. “They’re just letting all the foreigners in, and there is nothing left in the system for us,” she said. In the   spa town of Royal Tunbridge Wells, in the picturesque Kent countryside, Michael Selway, 54, expressed worry about the future of European integration. “This project was set up by people who had fantastic intentions  —   no more war  —   and now it might all come to a crashing end,” he said. Older voters are seen as being particularly disenchanted with the European Union, and younger voters more attracted to the possibility of studying and working on the Continent. But there were many exceptions. Helen Lickerman, 67, said there was a general tendency to move away from European integration. “Never mind the ins and outs of the economy,” she said at an interview at St. Giles Cripplegate Church in the Barbican, a residential and arts complex in the City of London, the capital’s financial district. “There’s a general feeling of being part of a community, and the history, the past wars, is something we don’t want anymore. ” Near Paddington Station just north of Hyde Park, Yamini Mathur, a    Londoner, said that voters had been more confused than enlightened by the blizzard of claims and counterclaims made during a series of debates. “We do not have all the answers, we do not have all the information, but I guess we will just have to go with all the information we have,” she said. The two officially designated campaigns  —   Vote Leave and Stronger In  —   continued to fire away on Twitter, in messages that reflected the sharply negative turn the debate has taken in a country where civility and decorum have been distinctive characteristics of the political culture. Vote Leave told its followers on Twitter: “Today’s referendum is about democracy. If you cherish it and it matters to you at all, then please #VoteLeave and #TakeBackControl. ” The campaign has relentlessly attacked the European Union as an unaccountable and faceless bureaucracy that is subsidized by Britain and offers little more than onerous directives in return, while forcing high levels of migrants onto Britain through its insistence on the free movement of labor, capital, goods and services. The Stronger In campaign has at times struggled to make a positive case for the   bloc, instead focusing on the economic hit that Britain  —   the bloc’s   economy, after Germany  —   would sustain if it lost access to a common market of more than 500 million people. Even enthusiasts acknowledge that the European Union, with its cumbersome governance, is hard to love, though they say it has helped to unite a Continent that nearly destroyed itself in two world wars. With the stumping over, politicians were left with little to do but vote. Three leaders of the Remain campaign  —   Mr. Cameron, whose Conservative Party is bitterly divided over the European Union, and the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, and Mayor Sadiq Khan of London  —   all voted in the capital. So did Boris Johnson, the former London mayor who has arguably been the most prominent face of the Leave campaign, and Michael Gove, the justice secretary.  Mr. Farage cast his ballot in Kent, in southeast England. It was only the third nationwide referendum in British history. In the first, in 1975, Britons affirmed their membership in the European Economic Community, a forerunner to the European Union, which they joined in 1973. In the second, in 2011, voters rejected a change to the system by which members of Parliament are elected.\n",

      "LONDON  —   The man charged with murdering the British lawmaker Jo Cox made his first court appearance on Saturday, telling the court when asked his name, “My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain. ” Thomas Mair, 52, had been charged earlier Saturday with murder and several other offenses, including inflicting grievous bodily harm and possession of a firearm. Mr. Mair, of the town of Birstall, appeared briefly at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London. Once charges have been brought, British media law prohibits any reporting about the case that might prejudice a trial. Ms. Cox, 41, a member of Parliament who advocated for immigrants’ causes, was gunned down on Thursday outside a library in Birstall, a town near the city of Leeds in northern England, as she was wrapping up a meeting with constituents. A    man was also slightly injured in the attack. Her death came just days before a referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union, and it led to an immediate suspension of campaigning on both sides out of respect for her memory. But Vote Leave, which supports Britain’s departure from the   bloc, said Friday that it would resume campaigning over the weekend. Issues of immigration and national identity have been central to the occasionally bitter clashes over the referendum, and critics say the tone of the debate has verged on racism and xenophobia. The killing of Ms. Cox  —   the first of a sitting member of Parliament since the Irish Republican Army assassinated Ian Gow, a Conservative lawmaker, in 1990  —   elicited an outpouring of sympathy in Britain, where gun ownership is strictly regulated. Ms. Cox, a member of the opposition Labour Party, was elected to Parliament to represent the area of Batley and Spen only in May 2015. But she had already established a strong reputation. Prime Minister David Cameron and his rival Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, both praised her as a rising star in British politics. President Obama was reported to have called Ms. Cox’s husband to offer condolences. “The president noted that the world is a better place because of her selfless service to others, and that there can be no justification for this heinous crime, which robbed a family, a community, and a nation of a dedicated wife, mother, and public servant,” Sky News reported, citing the White House.\n",

      "A traditionally reliable indicator, lurking in a recent opinion poll, suggests Britain will vote on Thursday to remain in the European Union. The main question that polling firms typically ask respondents in any contest is how they intend to vote. In the case of the referendum on “Brexit,” as a possible British exit from the E. U. is known, the polls straightforwardly ask people if they want to remain in the union or leave. After a string of polls showing a sizable lead for “leave,” polls released in the last few days effectively show a tie, or a small lead for remaining. This shift away from “leave” prompted a rally in global markets on Monday. But one of those polls, conducted by Survation, also asked voters which side they expected to win. Asking people to predict a result of an election has, over time, provided more accurate forecasts than asking people their voting intentions, according to a study by Justin Wolfers, a University of Michigan economist and an Upshot contributor, and David Rothschild, of the Microsoft Research and Statistics Center. When Survation asked, “Regardless of how you plan to vote, what do you think the result will be?” just shy of 40 percent of people said the “remain” camp would win. Only 26 percent said that “leave” would prevail. The remaining 34 percent said they did not know what the result would be. Mr. Rothschild said the “don’t know” figure is high for this sort of question. But he noted that undecided voters tend to support the status quo, in part because they are more   and may be less informed. Also notable: Supporters of the leave camp don’t seem to have a high level of confidence that their side will prevail. Some 35 percent of “leave” supporters said they thought “remain” would win. By contrast, only 14 percent of “remain” supporters predicted that “leave” would win. Of course, this is not a guaranteed indicator the Brexit referendum may be a vote that reveals its limitations. All things considered, though, “remain” seems to be in a strong position in these last days before the vote. The surge in the polls for “leave” appears to have been stalled, or even reversed. The betting markets suggest a roughly 75 percent chance of a victory for “remain. ”\n",

      "LONDON  —   If Britain wakes up on Friday morning to the news that it has voted itself out of the European Union, about the only thing that everyone is sure to agree on is that the nation will face a protracted political and legal mess. For all the drama the moment would bring, there would be no instant change. European Union citizens could still come to Britain to live and work without a visa. Trade with the single market would continue unimpeded. Brussels would continue to regulate bananas. Instead, the process of decoupling would officially begin only when the British government chooses to invoke a previously unused provision of the bloc’s governing treaty, known as Article 50, that sets out the basics of the withdrawal process. The most critical element of Article 50 is that, once invoked, it sets a   deadline for a negotiated departure. Beyond that, no one really knows how the process would work, since no country has ever left the European Union. Moreover, it is up to the British government when to invoke Article 50, and it is not entirely clear whether Prime Minister David Cameron, who has led the campaign to stay, would stick to his stated plan to invoke it immediately if the country votes to leave. In legal terms, the British government is not even bound by the result of Thursday’s referendum, which is generally considered a tossup at this point. In a report for the Constitution Society, Richard Gordon and Rowena Moffat said, “The government could, in strict law, choose to ignore it. ” Most members of Parliament  —   including the majority of the governing Conservatives in the House of Commons and nearly all of the opposition Labour Party  —   are also opposed to leaving the bloc, though Parliament would probably not get a direct vote on whether or when to invoke Article 50. Politically, however, it would be almost impossible to overlook the outcome of the first plebiscite on Britain’s place in Europe in 41 years. “Given the constitutional significance of the issue at stake,” the report’s authors say, “it is inconceivable that the government could choose not to be bound by the result. ” In fact, one of the few certainties about a vote in favor of Britain leaving the European Union  —   a Brexit  —   is that initially, at least, it will plunge capitals on both sides of the English Channel, but in Britain in particular, into  complex negotiations and political jockeying that could last for years. Despite Mr. Cameron’s plans to invoke Article 50 swiftly after the vote, he would face pressure to delay starting the   clock from those in his party who favor leaving. Their thinking is that before starting the clock, Britain should start informally negotiating a new trade deal with the European Union in tandem with the terms of Britain’s departure from the bloc. They suggest that Britain would lose considerable leverage in negotiating a new trade deal once it was outside the bloc, and that it could get a better trade deal as part of a negotiation that encompasses all aspects of the new   relationship. Once the   Article 50 term expires, Britain would be outside the single European market for services and become subject to possible tariffs on goods. The   camp does not want to negotiate a new trade pact with that clock ticking. But while Britain might want to move slowly to leave Europe, countries like France and Germany would want to move swiftly, to reduce Britain’s leverage. They can also be expected to take no prisoners in the negotiations, in an effort to limit political contagion by making a tough example of Britain for other member states. Yet there appears to be no mechanism to force Britain to invoke Article 50 and set the   clock running. Mr. Cameron’s assurances that he would do so in the event of a Brexit vote may not count for much, in that he may not survive such an outcome. Were he to quit, it would take the Conservative Party several weeks at least to select a successor. If he loses the referendum but decides to try to remain prime minister, as he has said he would, Britain could be consumed by political maneuvering for weeks or months, postponing a decision on how to proceed. “We don’t know who’s going to be in charge,” said Anand Menon, professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King’s College London. “The uncertainty extends to who’s going to be leading this show. ” Some Brexit supporters suggest that they could negotiate a departure without using Article 50. By contrast, in Brussels, there is discussion of somehow forcing the British to invoke it. Most legal experts say it would be impossible to avoid. Whatever Conservative government emerges would have to decide what kind of relationship to seek with the European Union, and get the British Parliament on its side for eventual ratification of a new arrangement covering trade and immigration, among other issues. The problem is, fewer than a third of the current Parliament members support leaving the bloc. Stephen Kinnock, an opposition Labour Party lawmaker, has said lawmakers might press for a relationship like Norway has with the European Union  —   outside the bloc but still having access to its single market. However, Norway not only pays into the bloc but also accepts the free movement of workers  —   two of the biggest and most emotional arguments Brexit supporters have made against membership in the European Union. Analysts say the arguments in Parliament could become so polarized that the government might be forced to seek new elections. But that would require changing a recently passed law on elections, and even then a new Parliament might still be hopelessly divided. Roger Liddle, a   Union member of the House of Lords and a chairman of the Policy Network research institute, said, “Even if, as is likely, within weeks of a ‘leave’ vote we would have a new Brexit government with a new prime minister, which may be reinforced by a general election victory within six to nine months, it is very unlikely that a majority in either House of Parliament could be found for a credible leave option. ” A vote to leave the bloc would put Britain in a worse position to curb European migration until it actually departed. In February Mr. Cameron negotiated limits on welfare payments as a disincentive to some European migrants, but this concession is conditional on a vote to remain. Not only would this deal be moot in the event of a Brexit vote, but European citizens might race to enter Britain before the gates are closed. Chris Grayling, a cabinet minister campaigning to leave the bloc, has proposed quick legislation to end the right of free movement before Britain leaves formally, something that would put Britain in breach of European Union law. While European law would be hard to enforce on a country in the bloc’s departure lounge, it is unclear whether British lawmakers would approve such a legally contentious step in any case. Even if they did, that would complicate exit negotiations and could provoke retaliatory measures from Continental Europe. If a deal can be reached within the two years, it may need to be ratified in all 28 member nations and perhaps approved by the Parliament in Scotland, where all major parties want to remain in the bloc. Some of those not normally given to hyperbole have deep misgivings about what could go wrong while disentangling Britain from four decades of European integration. “The   ghastliness of the legal complications is almost unimaginable,” Sir David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice and professor emeritus at Edinburgh University, told a committee of the House of Lords. Professor Menon said he worries most about the political leadership if Britain leaves: “Who’s providing it, who has the authority to do anything, and whether political contagion spreads to our European partners, which then leads to a hideous, ugly standoff before the negotiations have even started. ”\n",

      "In one of the most significant events in the modern history of the West, the U. K. voted on Thursday to sever itself from the European Union. [The Leave campaign’s rallying cry was to “make June 23rd Independence Day. ”  “If we vote to Leave, and take back control, we believe that this Thursday could be our country’s Independence Day!” former London mayor and Brexit advocate, Boris Johnson, declared earlier this week. Many have argued that this November —  two hundred forty years following America’s fight for independence —   the United States will be presented with a similar opportunity to cast off the globalist ideology that has dominated U. S. policies for decades. As nationally syndicated talk radio host Laura Ingraham tweeted on Wednesday: America’s #  vote is in Nov. —   Will USA remain a free, independent  sovereign nation or cede more control to a global order?  —   Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) June 22, 2016,  Sen. Jeff Sessions wrote in a USA Today   in which he laid out the case for Donald Trump against Hillary Clinton: For the first time in a long time, this November will give Americans a clear choice on perhaps the most important issue facing our country and our civilization: whether we remain a   that serves its own people, or whether we slide irrevocably toward a soulless globalism that treats humans as interchangeable widgets in the world market. In his article, Sessions described Clinton as a “committed globalist. ” Conservative icon Phyllis Schlafly has described this election as America’s “last chance. ” Echoing the nationalist themes of Brexit leaders, Trump has similarly framed this election as a referendum on U. S. sovereignty. “We will no longer surrender this country, or its people, to the false song of globalism,” Trump said during a recent foreign policy address. “Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first,” he said in a speech laying out what is at stake in the 2016 election, adding: We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism  —   focusing on what’s good for America’s middle class  —   to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy. As Schlafly has explained, the two most significant issues threatening national sovereignty today are the   Partnership (TPP) and our expansive immigration policy. Conservatives warn that entering the TPP agreement —   which has been championed by the globalist caucus in Washington including Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama —   will come at the expense of U. S. sovereignty. As Sessions has pointed out, Article 27. 1 of the TPP agreement will ensnare the U. S. in a global governing commission similar to a “nascent European Union” —   which had similarly begun as an economic agreement. “This nation has never seen an agreement that compares to the TPP, which forms a new Pacific Union,” Sessions said. “This is far more than a trade agreement, but creates a   and   Commission with extraordinary implications for American workers and American sovereignty. ” “These 5, 554 pages [of the TPP] are like the Lilliputians binding down Gulliver. They will enmesh our great country, and economy, in a global commission where bureaucrats from Brunei have the same vote as the United States,” Sessions declared. As Trump has similarly explained, “If [Hillary Clinton] is elected President, she will adopt the   Partnership   …     [and] we will lose our country. ” Indeed, a review of Bill and Hillary Clinton’s record reveals that perhaps no one represents the “false song of globalism” better than the Clintons. As former counselor to the secretary of Commerce, Clyde Prestowitz, has explained, much of the trade globalism that has come to define our current trade policies began in the 1990s under the Clintons’ rule. “In the 1990s, international trade morphed into the far broader and more complex phenomenon of globalization,” Prestowitz wrote: In 1992, the United States, Mexico and Canada essentially extended the 1988 U. S.  Free Trade Agreement into the North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA.   …     The agreement was essentially for an economic union, looser than but similar to the EU arrangement. Then in 1993, President Clinton hosted the first meeting of the leaders of   nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) who committed to greater economic integration of their nations. Finally in 1994, the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations concluded by turning the GATT into the World Trade Organization (WTO). Prestowitz explained that the WTO had significant implications for U. S. sovereignty —  namely, its establishment of “compulsory dispute settlement   …     essentially cut the United States off at the knees and made the WTO perhaps the most powerful international governing body. ” It meant that U. S. could no longer “act as its own policeman on global economic issues. ” “It really should have been called the World Globalization Organization,” Prestowitz added. Under President Clinton, the U. S. also negotiated China’s entrance into the WTO, which Prestowitz described as one of “America’s dumbest deals   …     [that] reduced American influence and power, and constrained its future   ability. ” Prestowitz explained that Clinton was motivated by his globalist ideology: “[He] embraced the notion that globalization and Americanization are more or less the same thing and saw globalization as the way to make the Chinese more like us. ” This ideology continues to dictate the Clintons’ worldview. Hillary Clinton played a major role in championing the TPP. In 2012, she declared that TPP “set the gold standard in trade agreements. ” Clinton’s decision to promote the TPP demonstrates her underlying support for the international structures that underpin globalism. In other words, a politician can look at the text of the final product of a trade deal and say that she would like to see tweaks to certain provisions of the deal however, someone who fundamentally opposes the idea of binding the nation to an international commission would not be able to support the TPP in any form. Clinton’s aggressive TPP boosting illustrates her support for international governing structures, in which foreign countries are given equal weight to determining aspects of U. S. economic policy and  . Yet Clinton’s globalist ideology is not limited to her views on trade. Clinton’s immigration policy similarly is guided by an internationalist worldview, and she has put forth an immigration agenda that would essentially result in the erasure of U. S. borders. Every year, the U. S. currently admits more than one million foreign nationals on green cards, one million foreign workers, dependents, and refugees, in addition to half a million foreign students. About nine out of every ten new immigrants brought into the country on green cards are from   countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East. Yet Clinton has pledged to increase this historic rate of immigration. She has said she will expand President Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesties, freeze deportations for aliens who have not yet been convicted of a crime, and dramatically expand U. S. refugee resettlement. Clinton has also rejected vetting processes that would prevent migrants who hold views that are antithetical to liberal Western values from entering the country. Moreover, given how U. S. voting rights work, Clinton’s policy will not only dissolve borders, but it will disenfranchise millions of Americans by essentially flooding and canceling out their votes with the votes of imported foreign citizens. In an exclusive 2014 interview with Breitbart News, UKIP’s Nigel Farage discussed the state of American politics and its parallels to the UK Independence movement. Farage observed that in the U. S. “there’s lots of will and energy to turn these things around, but, of course, the difficulty is money is very dominant in American politics, and a lot of the big donors probably want the Party to play safe whereas the activists don’t. ” Farage described this political moment as America’s “own battle,” as Breitbart reported two years ago: “It’s not easy, it’s not easy, because the big parties have become part of the establishment with the donors and patronage and with government contracts —  all of this actually working hand in glove, so it’s not easy,” Farage said. But the answer is actually pretty simple: Courage. Courage. You need a leader of the Republicans who’s prepared to say: “You know what? We’ll live without this. We’ll get our money somewhere else. We’ll do this differently. We’ll engage the people. ” It has to be done and it’s going to take courage. Indeed, in recent weeks, Hillary Clinton has resorted to   as part of her effort to combat Trump’s nationalist movement. She has made grave predictions about the U. S. reducing its foreign military entanglements, she has warned that Trump’s desire to crack down on the illicit practices of foreign trading partners will spark a “trade war,” and she has suggested that the U. S. cannot enforce its immigration laws —  and that attempting to do so is “bad economics. ” This is not dissimilar from the rhetoric of global elites who sought to stoke fear about leaving the EU. As Boris Johnson explained, “There is a very clear choice between those on their side who speak of nothing but fear of the consequences of leaving the EU, and we on our side who offer hope. ” Since Ted Kennedy’s immigration rewrite was passed in 1965, the U. S. has added 59 million immigrants. The U. S middle class has shrunk ten percentage points since 1970, and real average wages are lower today than they were in 1973, shortly after the nation’s green card gusher began. America traces its lineage to centuries of British history and millennia of Western history, and yet, in just a few short decades since the immigration caps were removed in 1965, the U. S. has become demographically and ideologically representative of all nations of the earth, and it now faces the challenge of whether it will Balkanize or remain a   country.\n",

      "House Speaker Paul Ryan signals his support for the United Kingdom, after the country’s voters passed a referendum to leave the European Union. [“As an American, we value the principle of sovereignty,   government by consent and limited government,” Ryan said during a press conference today. “These are very important principles and these principles are being expressed here at home and around the world. We clearly understand the thinking behind these principles. ”  Ryan did not celebrate passage of the referendum, but reaffirmed the commitment of the United States to sustain the special relationship with Britain. “Our friends in the United Kingdom are our indispensable ally and this is a very special relationship and that relationship is going to continue no matter what. Period. End of story,” he said. He dismissed the volatile reaction by the stock markets around the world, assuring Americans that they would stabilize. “Obviously markets are going to react when new news and information like this occurs. I believe that markets will eventually stabilize,” he said. Ryan indicated that the tax reform plan released by House Republicans today would help America lead the world economy. “For all of these moments of possible uncertainty that are happening around the globe, having strong powerful confident American economic leadership is in need, and this does that,” he said. Earlier in the day, Ryan released a statement noting that he respected the decision made by British voters. “I respect the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom,” he said. “The UK is an indispensable ally of the United States, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote. ”\n",

      "Fox News financial analyst Gary Kaltbaum found the vicious elitist backlash against Brexit voters unsurprising, during his appearance on Breitbart News Daily with SiriusXM host Stephen K. Bannon on Friday morning. [“Voters are always idiots when they disagree with the glitterati, as they say,” Kaltbaum observed.  He predicted markets would “shake and shudder,” and “there’s going to be a lot of scare tactics, there’s going to be a lot of yelling and screaming from people that are on the wrong side of this, and probably the markets are going to be on the defensive for a while. ” “But I’ve got news for you  —   the United Kingdom will go back to work, do their thing,” he continued. “They’re a huge trading partner of the EU, that’s going to continue. The people that wanted to keep this together, and are trying to keep the EU together, are going to lie, cheat, steal to try to turn back the clock, but I doubt it works at this point. ” “I’m already hearing about France, Italy, Netherlands people calling for their own referendum, so this is going to get interesting in the next few weeks,” Kaltbaum said. He didn’t have much faith in President Obama’s threat to punish a Leave vote by refusing to sign bilateral trade agreements with the   United Kingdom. “Listen, greed wins out,” Kaltbaum said. “I can promise you, you’re going to hear some tough talk from the EU, but the fact of the matter is, they’ve got to trade, and due to the fact that the UK is gargantuan and a big trading partner, they’re not going to cut their socialist noses off to spite their socialist faces. ” “The big question is going to be: what domino is next to fall?” he said. “And if we do see more dominoes fall, then I would tell you all bets are off. ” Kaltbaum said he was surprised by how “the media played this like it was a ‘gimme’ that they were going to stay. ” “I am just of the utter opinion here that this is an absolute repudiation of    immigration, distant unaccountable leaders that are telling what a country has to do, and    welfare state scare tactics,” he declared. “David Cameron was saying there was going to be war. And President Obama interjects himself and says that ‘you’re going to the back of the queue.’ Doesn’t say ‘back of the line,’ which is an American phrase  —   he uses the European phrase. And I think that pissed off enough people, and I think that actually moved the needle in the direction that it went. ” As for Brexit’s effect on the U. S. presidential election, and the curious silence from the Clinton camp until late in the morning, Kaltbaum said, “I think Hillary’s AWOL because she’s in a room right now with all her minions  —   how do we answer this?” “She doesn’t have a straightforward thought. It’s a matter of, oh, we gotta measure this, we gotta gauge this, we gotta decide this, then we’ll come out,” he said. “Notice Donald Trump comes out naturally with his thoughts, whether they jibe or whether they don’t. As far as Hillary’s concerned, this is bad for her. It’s as simple as that. ” “Donald Trump is talking about a nation, a great nation, that has gone from a great democracy, that has been going toward socialism, that has been going towards open borders  —   everything that this country was made of, it has been going the wrong way,” he elaborated. “I’m pretty sure you’re going to see some momentum in the poll numbers, in the next week or so, for Trump, just based on this. ” “You’ve got to remember something: he’s on the right side of things,” Kaltbaum said of Trump’s position. “There’s so much talk from Hillary about  —   you know, I listened to her speech the other day, the whole frickin’ speech is, what’s government going to do for you, and how much we’re going to spend on you, while Trump keeps talking about how great you guys are going to be, and how great this country’s going to be again, because of all our hard work, not what Washington D. C. does. ” “So I’m pretty sure this sucker’s going to resonate in the next few weeks, and I think the needle’s going to pretty much move, and I think the Hillary Express may be on its back for a little bit,” Kaltbaum predicted. He characterized the drop in the value of the pound after Brexit as “a   reaction. ” “I think there’s more to play out on that,” he said. “Keep in mind, the UK has had their own currency for a long time. They told the EU to take a fly with the Euro. They didn’t want a part of that. ” “I’m not worried about the UK at all,” Kaltbaum declared. “Keep in mind, there are 500 million people in the EU, and I can promise you, they’re going to be trading with the UK from today, and going forward, regardless of this. For me, the big wild card right now is who’s next, and how quickly is it going to be for some of these other countries? Because just remember: this is no longer about government say, this is about people say, and if the people start speaking up in these other countries, I think all hell is breaking loose, my friend. ” Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

      "A senior policy analyst at the   Cato Institute told Breitbart News one of the most certain turning points in the Brexit referendum campaign was the April 22 joint press conference with Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama, where Obama endorsed Cameron’s case for the United Kingdom staying in the European Union. [“It backfired massively,” said Marian Tupy, who is also the editor of Cato’s  HumanProgress. org.  A reporter asked the president if the United States would be open to negotiating with a United Kingdom that had left the European Union. “I think it’s fair to say that maybe some point down the line, there might be a  . S. trade agreement, but it’s not going to happen anytime soon,” Obama said. “Our focus is in negotiating with a big bloc, the European Union, to get a trade agreement done, and the UK is going to be in the back of the queue. ” The British resent foreign leaders telling them what to do and how to conduct their lives, the economist said. “It was exactly the wrong thing to say,” he said. “It was arrogant, ignorant and   —  and Obama ought to be ashamed of himself. ” Because Obama used the British term “queue,” instead of the American phrasing: back of the line, Tupy said what was already heard by British voters as arrogant and threatening, also came off as contrived with most assuming the wording was handed to him as part of a script from Cameron. “In exchange for spending a lovely weekend with him and his family with the queen he had to deliver a backing of Cameron. ” Tupy said in the end, Brexit was the best choice for the United Kingdom and he fully expects other countries, such as the Netherlands, to leave as well. Some of the richest countries in Europe, Switzerland, Norway and Luxembourg are not in the European Union and they are very prosperous, he said. “There are 6. 5 billion people in the world that are not in the European Union. The UK can trade with them. ”\n",

      "BuzzFeed is cancer, but sometimes cancer gets it right. Here’s BuzzFeed UK correspondent James Ball on Nigel Farage, who Ball declares a “winner” of EU Referendum.  Farage, who has led UKIP for most of the last decade, has seen his party rise to around 13% of the national vote, and despite conceding the referendum result early in the evening,     and   again, has found himself on the winning side of the vote. Expect Farage to be a vocal contributor from the sidelines of the UK’s exit negotiations  —   if the UK looks likely to make concessions such as joining the EEC (Europe’s free trade area) without major exceptions to its usual rules, he’ll publicly cry betrayal. Farage wants a full Brexit vote, with full freedom from EU rules. Anything less than that and we’ll hear about it. One ironic turn to Farage’s day of glory: He’s voted himself out of a job.

      "The Washington Post is reporting that U. S. might not be able to follow in the U. K.’s footsteps in reclaiming its economic independence because of the nation’s demographic makeup, which is the result of four decades of record high green card issuances to foreign nationals. [In a piece entitled, “No, Brexit Isn’t A Good Sign For Trump,” Washington Post’s Kim Soffen writes:  “There are certainly similarities between the referendum and the [Trump] campaign. Both are largely driven by immigration  …     Both are nationalist movements. Both are an instance of the will of the people going against the wishes of the elite  …     And their demographic support looks quite similar too. ” Yet Soffen writes that Brexit may not be a harbinger for Donald Trump’s future electoral success because the U. S. does not have as many white voters as Britain does. “Largely at issue here is demographics. The British electorate is overwhelmingly white  —   87 percent of its population is, according to its 2011 census. That’s compared to the United States’ 74 percent in 2014. That difference is significant for what direction each country votes. ” Indeed, while establishment media has pushed the narrative that immigration is a much more significant issue in Europe than it is the U. S. the facts do not bear this out. The U. S. has accepted 10 million more migrants from outside its borders than the European Union has absorbed from outside its borders, even though the EU has 200 million more people than the United States. Indeed, according to the U. S. Census Bureau, minority babies now outnumber white babies in the United States. Soffen reports that polling data suggests   tended to support the globalist position over the nationalist policy. “Just like more   areas in the United States, like cities, tend to vote Democrat,   areas in the United Kingdom tended to vote to stay in the EU. In London, where 60 percent of citizens are   according to the 2011 Census, 60 percent of votes went against Brexit, compared to 48 percent nationwide. ” “Since the U. S. is far more diverse than the U. K. Brexit’s predictive power is even weaker,” Soffen concludes. The Washington Post suggests that in order to have nationalist policies, the U. S. has to have a large population of whites in its country. Perversely, the Washington Post is essentially arguing that foreign nationals do not seem to have a strong enough allegiance to their new country to support a nationalist agenda over a more global, internationalist agenda  —   an argument, which dramatically undercuts the Washington Post’s general narrative on immigration and contradicts a core theme of its human interests stories, which seem designed to advance legislation that would expand U. S. immigration. The demographic makeup the United States —  which the Washington Post posits is the reason the U. S. could perhaps be incapable of voting in favor of reclaiming its national sovereignty —  is the result of a Ted   1965 immigration rewrite, which opened up America’s borders to the world. Kennedy’s immigration law lifted the immigration caps that had been place and opened up U. S. visas to migrants all across the globe. While about nine in ten of the immigrants who came to the United States during the 19th and 20th century hailed from Europe, the 1965 law inverted that figure. Today about nine out of every ten new immigrants brought into the country on green cards come from   countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia or the Middle East. Following the law’s passage, 59 million immigrants entered the United States. Including their children, it added 72 million new residents to the U. S. population. In 1965, according to Pew, the country was 84 percent white, 11 percent black, 4 percent Hispanic and less than 1 percent Asian —   i. e. it had a white population that very similar in size to the white population of the U. K. today. Unless Congress proposes legislation to curb the U. S. autopilot visa issuances, Pew projects that in forty years time as a result of   immigration, “no racial or ethnic group will constitute a majority of the U. S. population,” as “whites are projected to become less than half of the U. S. population by 2055. ” Therefore, by 2065, the nation would be 46 percent white, 24 percent Hispanic, 14 percent Asian and 13 percent black. However, members of the globalist caucus in Washington including House Speaker Paul Ryan, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and President Barack Obama, have all pushed to accelerate this demographic transformation and have championed proposals to dramatically expand the nation’s record high immigration admissions.  \n",

      "1. The Secret of the English People,  Britain’s departure from the European Union is a victory for English nationalism. Now we’ll have to see what happens to American nationalism. But first, a bit more on the United Kingdom: What is English nationalism, anyway? On June 23, the day of the Brexit vote, Englishman James Delingpole wrote a stirring piece for Breitbart News under the headline, “If You Truly Believe In Britain There’s Only One Way To Vote Today  …    ” In it, he offered a tribute to his heritage, as he explained what nationalist patriotism means to him: It means a heartfelt sympathy with our island story —    Magna Carta the Civil War the Glorious Revolution Waterloo 1940 “Our Finest Hour” and so on and an appreciation of the achievements of the heroes and heroines who made it possible, from Alfred the Great through to Queen Elizabeth I, from Shakespeare to Elgar, from Florence Nightingale and Isambard Kingdom Brunel to Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. And knowing that the European Union is the conscious and deliberate obliteration of all valued European traditions, we can quickly see that a true English patriot had no choice but to vote “Leave. ” Indeed, the EU is a peculiarly toxic beast that should be offensive to patriots of all countries: It’s one part Orwellian Superstate, one part politically correct playpen, and one part   source for future Islamist terrorists, all serving the financial interests of a few big banks and financiers. Meanwhile, the EU can’t, or won’t, defend itself against alien invasion. Just on Thursday, the day of the vote, some 4500 Africans came ashore in Italy  —   that’s an annual rate of more than 1. 6 million. Yes, it’s truly a Camp of the   situation, and yet many in the EU seem happy at the prospect of being relieved of the “burden” of their European ethnicity. However, the English are made of sterner stuff. It’s interesting that much of the Old Left in the UK  —   that is,   Labour blue collars  —   came to support “Leave,” even as the new Labour elite, snug and smug in its   government financing from both London and Brussels, urged a vote for “Stay. ” As one Labourite observed in April: Labour’s working class heartland of voters overwhelmingly want Brexit, yet the Labour Party isn’t listening. Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, patriotic conservatives, too, were outraged at the naked attempt to   corporate   down the throats of ordinary blokes. One Tory MP recalled a telling moment on the Brexit campaign trail: I was amazed, when the CEO of JP Morgan shared a platform with the chancellor [of the exchequer, equivalent to the US treasury secretary] in Bournemouth and basically warned these voters “If you guys vote for Brexit you will be out of a job. ” This CEO earns $20 million a year and lives mostly in Manhattan, telling people who earn £25, 000 a year they will be out of a job if they vote a certain way. This enrages people. Yes, when those in the elite listen only to others in the elite  —   that’s a formula for revolution. And that’s what happened on Thursday, hereafter to be called, as the heroic Nigel Farage has urged, “British Independence Day. ” On BID, the people overcame mountains of cronyish propaganda  —   and a direct threat from international speculator George Soros, who has proven many times that he can do real harm  —   to vote “aye” on Brexit. Yes, Englishmen and women, so stoic and patient for so long, finally rose up. One is reminded of the 1907 historical poem by G. K. Chesterton, The Secret People. In that work, Chesterton described the English folk, stoically tolerating the errors of their “betters,” always keeping a stiff upper lip. But, he continued, some day, the dam will burst: Smile at us, pay us, pass us but do not quite forgetFor we are the people of England, that never have spoken yet. In his poetic narrative, Chesterton recounted a long parade of bad rulers over the English, including, for a time, the Norman conquerors from France: The fine French kings came over in a flutter of flags and dames. We liked their smiles and battles, but we never could say their names. Yet through it all, the English yeomanry kept its stolid cool. Skipping ahead centuries, Chesterton lyricized the brave English in their battles against Napoleon the courageous redcoats went overseas to fight, even as the families of many of them were still little more than serfs. Yet although the poem was composed more than a century ago, some of its lines read as if they were written by a contemporary. Here’s his scathing description of the English ruling class: Lords without anger or honour, who dare not carry their swords. They fight by shuffling papers they have bright dead alien eyesThey look at our labour and laughter as a tired man looks at flies. Indeed, Chesterton was an acute observer of the wide gap between the governors and the governed: We hear men speaking for us of new laws strong and sweet, Yet is there no man speaketh as we speak in the street. And then Chesterton closes with words he had used before  —   although, in their context and repetitive cadence, those words now take on an air of menace: But we are the people of England and we have not spoken yet. Smile at us, pay us, pass us. But do not quite forget. Now, in 2016, the English people have spoken. And as a result, David Cameron, that   stooge of a prime minister, has had to resign his whole career in politics has proven to be nothing more than quixotic  . Today, the English have reclaimed their ancient liberties and, most importantly, their right to their own national  . In the future, an independent England might rise or fall, but Albion is a lot more likely to rise if the English can chart their own destiny. 2. The Destiny of the American People, So the British Lion has finally roared. Next, will the American Eagle soar? If Breitbart News’s James Delingpole starts his British patriotic litany back in 1066, we Americans might start ours more recently, in 1776. And then we could amiably amble our way through the pantheon of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Clara Barton, Thomas Edison, Lou Gehrig, Mike Strank, Martin Luther King, Jr. and so many others. And then, after paying somber homage to the heroes of Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, Bastogne, Porkchop Hill, and Khe Sanh, we close our patriotic reverie with a glimpse of Ronald Reagan. (Yes, the three decades since his presidency have been a little dry, American  .) In the paragraph above, we see the key elements of American patriotism. And of course, for the most part, the Obama administration is either oblivious or hostile  —   that is, oblivious to the mystic chords of U. S. history or else hostile to their true meaning. To illustrate, we can point out that Martin Luther King’s dream of national colorblindness, in which we are judged, instead, on the “content of our character,” is not at all the same thing as the sort of quotacratic “diversity” that is bureaucratically imposed in his name. So already, we can see that an upsurge in American patriotism is a bad sign for the   status quo. As some liberals at Bloomberg News observed in a headline, “Trump’s Coalition Looks a Lot Like Brexit Voters. ” Or, in the words of Politico, the Bible of the Beltway, The Brexit vote became largely a referendum on elites and immigration, the same themes likely Republican nominee Donald Trump has put at the center of his bid for the White House. In that same vein, one must assume that The Daily Beast’s Nico Hines intended the pun when he wrote of Brexit, “Arguments about loss of sovereignty and loss of border control trumped the grave economic forecasts. ” Yes, TRUMPED. For his part, Donald Trump himself obviously gets it: “I see a big parallel,” he said of Brexit. Then he added: People want to take their country back, and they want to have independence in a sense. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. And now, of course, Trump’s   trip to Scotland looks shrewd, indeed  —   a Brexit gamble that has paid off handsomely. In the near term, we can immediately see that this new   spirit spells trouble for a pending trade deal involving America that could have easily been written by the EU, such as TPP, or TTIP, which actually was written by the EU. Looking further ahead, this ornery   populism sounds like trouble for an elitist such as Hillary Clinton, eh? After all, as First Lady, as a U. S. Senator, and as Secretary of State, Clinton not only supported the EU and every possible trade deal, but she also endorsed the even more comprehensively globalist climate change deal signed in 2015 by her successor at State, John Kerry. And now predictably, the political backlash is setting in, and it’s fierce. Writing for the Cook Political Report prior to the vote, Amy Walter described a focus group she attended in Western Pennsylvania that was notable for the Trumpian nationalism of its participants. Walter summed it up: “They really don’t like Hillary. ” Of course, the 2016 campaign is not over yet, and so perhaps Clinton, always flexible, will yet seek to ingratiate herself with American nationalists. Or perhaps not  —   perhaps she will conclude that, as a matter of electoral calculation, she first needs to keep faith with the Obama legacy, and the Obama ego. Yet while the political indicators are promising for Trump Republicans, there’s still no guarantee that America will follow Britain’s lead and vote for independence from the bureaucrats. Yes, the politics of the two countries are broadly similar, but if Britain zigged on Brexit, America could yet zag and elect Hillary. Yet in times of uncertainty, American patriots have one true reserve: our own grand history. After all, we’ve been through tough times before and pulled through  —   and we can do it again. We might, for example, take heart from the wise words of Ronald Reagan, who, back on October 27, 1964, on a   during his long march to the White House, said this to a national TV audience: You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We’ll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we’ll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness. Those words, “rendezvous with destiny,” echo in our minds because, yes, the stakes for the nation are that high  —   they always are. In electing Reagan back in 1980, the American people measured up to the moment  —   and the United States was the big winner. So now, in 2016, we have another rendezvous with destiny. And yes, haze from the fog of war will be thick, and so it will be difficult, often, to maintain our orientation and stick to the battle plan  —   the true course. Yet we know we can do it, because, as the Gipper told us, “We are Americans. ” And we like to think that the Gipper’s spirit is with us, even now. For his part, Trump will be challenged, as well, to keep his calm and composure  —   and stay relentlessly on message. Yet in the coming times of trial, he might be comforted by the lyrics of a famous pop song of his youth, from 1964. Those words are from Sam Cooke: “A change is gonna come. ” Yes, it will, God willing.\n",

      "The media elites are somewhat right that the Brexit victory was about the UK voters’ disdain for globalization, immigration, and lost pride, but the real cause of the British asking for an EU divorce was the $46. 6 billion in hard costs for intangible benefits. [Open Europe is a   think tank with offices in London and Brussels that produces an annual report measuring the cost burden of 40, 000   legal acts, 15, 000 Court verdicts and 62, 000 international standards on the United Kingdom.  Their 2015 report for the “Top 100” regulations estimated the financial burden on the UK economy at $46. 6 billion. To put that drain on the economy in perspective, the top 100 EU regulations cost more than the $37. 8 billion in local property taxes, called “Council Tax,” paid by British citizens to the UK Treasury last year. The top five costliest   regulations in force in the UK were: 1) UK Renewable Energy Strategy cost: 6. 6 billion a year2) Capital Requirement Directive IV on financial institutions: $5. 9 billion a year3) Working Time Directive on labor standards: $5. 9 billion a year4) EU Climate and Energy Package mandates: $4. 8 billion a year and5) Temporary Agency Workers Directive on welfare: $3. 0 billion a year, EU bureaucrats cleverly claim that the annual economic benefits to British citizens as members of the EU are $82 billion. But $65. 2 billion of the   benefits stem from three unmeasurable and vastly   items. As an example, the EU bureaucracy claims that the UK receives $29 billion in “value” for participating in a global pact to reduce carbon emissions. But that falsely assumes that the Paris United Nations Framework on Climate Control treaty was fully implemented by all 196 participating countries with immediate mandated curbs on emissions, increases in renewable energy,   reductions in deforestation that will achieve a global warming temperature reduction of 2. 7 to 3. 5 degrees centigrade. The final Paris agreement is only “voluntary” and exempts China and India, the worst polluters, for decades. The UK Parliament’s   “Impact Assessments” (IA) analysis of the EU’s regulations revealed that Prime Minister David Cameron’s Administration signed off on at least 26 of the top 100   regulations, despite the IA explicitly stating that the financial costs outweighed the estimated benefits. According to Open Europe: “Another 31 of the most costly   regulations have still not been quantified. Between the   benefits, the regulations that come with a net cost and the ones with quantified benefits, it remains unclear how many of these   rules actually come with a net benefit in reality. ” Although Open Europe’s analysis found the cost of membership in the EU far outdistanced the tangible benefits, the organization does believe there is substantial value in free trade between Britain and the other 27 EU members. Open Europe suggests that with the approval of the Brexit, the UK should work to negotiate a type of trading and cooperation relationship called the “Norway Option. ” After the Nordic country voted down a 1972 and a 1994 referendum to join the EU, Norway negotiated a   relationship with the EU through its membership of the European Economic Area. The EEA agreement allows free movement of persons, goods, services and capital within the internal market of the European Union. The only supposed “cost” if the UK negotiates a similar relationship is that British will not be able to vote on the onerous Rules written by EU bureaucrats and hated by a vast majority of the UK public.\n",

      "They said, ”Let’s go,” shocking the entire world.  No country has ever left the   European Union . .. until now. On Thursday, June 23, the United Kingdom voted to separate from the EU    sending financial markets reeling,   a world power’s leadership and triggering a wave of emotion across Europe.  This is how the dramatic decision unfolded, how you’re affected and what happens now: THE FINAL RESULTS, Hold up . ..  Not everyone wants to leave. The majority in Scotland voted to stay. It will now hold its own referendum to leave the UK and remain with the EU. ​The map tells a very big story. THE DRAMA, Some called it a catastrophe. Others said it was a revolution. But one thing is certain: The UK’s vote exposed a significant rift among its people. THE GENERATIONAL DIVIDE, Polling data leading up to the vote consistently showed that younger voters wanted to remain part of the EU, and they were angry about the final results.   ”I’m so angry. A generation given everything: Free education, golden pensions, social mobility have voted to strip my generation’s future,” Adam Newman from Bristol said on Twitter. THE LEADERS, Is Boris next? Former London Mayor Boris Johnson, who campaigned hard to leave the EU, is Davd Cameron’s likely successor as prime minister. Johnson was greeted by a booing crowd the morning after the vote. THE PLUMMET, As the vote swung toward ”leave,” the British pound dropped to its lowest level in more than 30 years.  Meanwhile it was a dark day for the market as tumbling stocks hit Europe, Asia, London and Wall Street.  THE MONEY QUESTIONS YOU’RE ASKING, Is this 2008 all over again? Although investors across the world went into panic mode as stocks tumbled, experts urged everyone to keep calm. ”This may be more of a political crisis than a financial crisis. That makes this different from Lehman Brothers going under in 2008,” Chris Gaffney, president of EverBank World Markets, told CNN Money. ”It does not look like this is a liquidity crisis. But it’s a big deal.” What about jobs? Leaving the EU could put many jobs at risk. Many American and global banks and companies have invested heavily in the UK as a gateway to Europe. Some companies could relocate staff to avoid obstacles in business.  Will Britain’s European workers have to leave? An estimated 1. 9 million   migrants are working in the UK. Things won’t change right away, but it’s unclear what will happen in the future. They have at least two years to keep working. How will this affect travel? If you’re a foreign traveler, good news! It’s cheaper to go to the UK due to the falling British pound. (Ahh, the silver lining.) The UK will probably see fewer tourists from the EU, which made up seven of the top 10 countries that visited last year. But don’t even get us started on those longer lines at immigration. .. But what if I am a British traveler?  You can most likely breathe a sigh of relief. Because Britain isn’t part of Europe’s borderless Schengen zone, you’re already checked at entrance points in   nations. You can show your passport, but you won’t need a stamp to enter. This probably won’t change even after Brexit.  WHAT’S NEXT, Even though the EU now wants a swift exit, this won’t happen overnight. It will take two years. HOW DID IT COME TO THIS? The UK has had a rocky relationship with Europe for decades.\n",

      " (CNN) Scotland will likely seek independence for a second time this decade after the historic vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Friday. Sturgeon’s Scottish National Party was elected on a platform that vowed, in part, to revisit the independence issue    last decided in a failed 2014 referendum    should the country be ”taken out of the EU against our will,” Sturgeon said. ”Scotland does now face that prospect,” Sturgeon said. ”It is a significant and material change in circumstances, and it is therefore a statement of the obvious that the option of a second referendum must be on the table, and it is on the table.” Scotland is one of four countries that make up the United Kingdom. England, Wales and Northern Ireland are the others. Scottish voters overwhelmingly backed remaining in the EU, 62% in favor of staying to 38% who want to leave. Sturgeon said her government would begin preparing legislation for a new referendum that could be held before the UK formally leaves the EU    two years from when the government formally notifies the bloc of its intent to drop out. She said she felt it unlikely that UK leaders would try to block the effort, saying it is ”highly likely” that a new independence referendum will be held. In the 2014 vote, 55% of Scottish voters cast ballots in favor of remaining in the United Kingdom, but Sturgeon said Friday that many of those who voted against independence then are reassessing their positions in light of Thursday’s decision.\n",

      "Washington (CNN) Britain’s vote to leave the European Union Friday left the United States confronting a threat to the strength and cohesion of both its closest historical ally and a   transatlantic partnership that has been the bedrock of Western peace and prosperity. The outcome of Britain’s referendum instantly pitched an already weakened Europe into a new crisis, opening the possibility that other member states could choose to leave the E. U. and create new headaches for Washington. American leaders on all sides of the political aisle Friday expressed respect for the decision of British voters and vowed to stand with America’s ”special relationship” ally Britain and the diminished European Union once both partners have finalized their divorce    a period that could take years. But there was no hiding the concern behind the scenes as the shockwaves rippled through the EU, a body that has been vital to American foreign policy initiatives in recent times, including the drive to a nuclear deal with Iran and attempts to punish Russia for its incursion in Ukraine. RELATED: Trump on Brexit: America is next, President Barack Obama, who felt strongly enough about a British exit or ”Brexit” to travel to Britain in April to warn it could not expect special treatment on reaching a free trade deal with the U. S. if it left Europe, offered a rote assurance that nothing would actually change between London and Washington. ”While the UK’s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said during remarks at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. ”That will endure.” But Sir Peter Westmacott, until earlier this year Britain’s ambassador in Washington, contradicted the idea that nothing would change in the U.  relationship. ”I feel very sad,” Westmacott told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, adding that Britain after Brexit would be ”less influential in the world, in the European Union, in NATO and the Security Council and a less significant ally for the United States and many others.” ”I think we are going to have to paddle even harder with our diplomacy . .. to ensure that we continue to ensure that we have our place at the table.” Vice President Joe Biden, the administration’s   voice, was more clear about White House disappointment at the result when he spoke to the issue on a trip to Ireland Friday. ”I must say we had looked for a different outcome,” he said in Dublin. ”We preferred a different outcome.” For the United States, the possibility that the populist, isolationist victory of the ”Leave” vote translates into broader political victories for the movement in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, could mean Washington could eventually find itself straining to get help it has relied on from allies. The UK vote has triggered calls for similar referendums in France, Sweden and the Netherlands, while populist governments already hold power in Greece, Poland and Hungary. If the Brexit vote results in a   ripple of similar votes or political victories, the experiment of a united Europe could come to an end. It would make the continent less able to help the U. S. push back against Russian assertiveness along Europe’s eastern seam, analysts said. The United States has traditionally relied on an engaged Britain, alongside other allies Germany and France, as a way to ensure its interests are taken into account on the top table of Europe    and now faces the prospect of one of its most influential allies leaving the block and diminishing its clout. For the UK, it’s not just the EU exit that could cause Britain’s influence to wane. If Europhile Scotland now holds a second independence vote, the power of Washington’s old ally could be further splintered. Britain has been a traditional U. S. partner on efforts to stabilize Afghanistan and cooperate in the Middle East on issues ranging from Iran’s nuclear program to   peace and the scourge of ISIS. One outcome of the Brexit vote could be ”less help from the UK and other NATO allies in the Middle East and elsewhere,” said Daniel Serwer, director of the Conflict Management Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. In the short term, a distracted UK, led by a lame duck leader following Cameron’s decision to step down, might not have the same capacity or inclination to take on global challenges. RELATED: Can Donald Trump be a CEO and a president? And the economic hit the UK will take as it extricates itself from a market that accounts for 44% of its exports could leave it with fewer resources to do its share. The U. S. is itself already feeling the aftershocks    American stocks were down more than 600 points at the closing bell Friday afternoon. Altogether, that could mean a smaller Britain, less able to meet its defense commitments, and it would pose problems for the future of the U. K.’s independent nuclear deterrent, which is based in Scotland and is opposed by the ruling Scottish Nationalist Party. It could also deepen the U. S. perception that took root under the Obama administration that the U. S. ”interests lie more in Asia than in its traditional Atlantic sphere of influence,” according to Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, writing in The Washington Post. Still, American political figures stressed their commitment to the UK despite the change. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, tweeted that ”the UK is an indispensable ally of the US, and that special relationship is unaffected by this vote.” Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, said that ”while there will be a great deal of discussion in the coming days and weeks about what the ’Leave’ win means for them and for us, our friends and allies in the UK should know this: we respect their decision, and we stand by them, just as they have always stood by us.” The President spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday to convey the U. S. commitment to both of them, saying afterwards that the EU will remain a ”vital” U. S. partner, alongside NATO. ”Our shared values including our commitment to democracy and pluralism . .. will continue to unite all of us,” Obama said, repeating a common theme in his addresses as criticism of immigrants and religious minorities has featured in the presidential campaign. But the administration is also looking to adjust to the new reality. ”What was said was we believed in a strong UK voice in a strong EU and that was our position in advance of the referendum,” said State Department spokesman John Kirby. ”The people of Great Britain have spoken and they want the UK out of the EU that’s beyond dispute, and so we now have to move on.” Amid the widespread shock at Britain’s decision, Washington is beginning to size up the implications. ”For sure,” said Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken Friday, ”it’s going to be a complicated process.”\n",

      "Washington (CNN) British voters just shattered political convention in a stunning repudiation of the ruling establishment. Donald Trump is betting America is about to do the same. Voters in the UK did more than reject the European Union and topple their   Prime Minister David Cameron in a referendum Thursday. They also set off a cascade of events that could spark global economic chaos, remake the Western world, reverberate through November’s presidential election and challenge U. S. security for years to come. At Trump news conference, it’s all about him, The referendum campaign    just like the U. S. election    has boiled with populist anger,   by politicians, hostility towards distant political elites and resurgent nationalism, and exposed a visceral feeling in the electorate that ordinary voters have lost control of the politics that shape their own lives. Its success raises the question of whether those forces will exert a similar influence in America in November. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who arrived in the UK to visit his Scottish golf courses just as the referendum result was announced, declared Friday that the U. S. is next. ”Come November, the American people will have the chance to   their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first,” he said. ”They will have the chance to reject today’s rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.” Indeed, British voters delivered the kind of crushing rejection of the political, business and media elites that Trump has been railing against. The Brits also snubbed President Barack Obama’s warnings against voting to leave Europe and risked triggering a global recession that would weaken already sluggish U. S. economic growth and dampen the hopes of his chosen successor, Hillary Clinton. In her first reaction to the news from Britain, Clinton immediately took a swipe at Trump, though not by name. She called for Americans to respond to the vote by pulling together ”to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down.” Clinton also noted the global economic risks of the UK referendum, saying in a statement: ”Our first task has to be to make sure that the economic uncertainty created by these events does not hurt working families here in America.”  In a particularly striking development, UK voters completely disregarded warnings from elite voices of the consequences of tearing the political system that has largely delivered peace and prosperity since World War II. Similar warnings have been heard in the U. S. election    especially from Clinton and establishment politicians who fear Trump’s ”America First” stance would send shockwaves through the global system and see America pull back from its role as a guarantor of Western security. But in the UK this week, outsider politicians seem to have carried just as much weight with many British voters as more conventional   arguments. World authorities like the IMF for example warned about the consequences of a Brexit    but voters went ahead and voted to leave anyway. RELATED: Can Donald Trump be a CEO and a president? Speaking to CNN, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair described the Brexit result as a ”big experiment in insurgent politics.” He said the   and   needed to ”rediscover radical, powerful answers in a climate driven by anger . .. a revolt against what is seen as established wisdom, but what is actually people making difficult decisions in difficult circumstances.” There are, of course, several key differences between the British referendum and America’s looming election. The UK vote was mostly about delivering a stunning and final blow to the country’s long and reluctant marriage with Europe and turned on a host of local factors including extreme   within the governing Conservative Party, distrust of European politicians and institutions and disenchantment with Britain’s reduced place in the world. Trump: Brexit a declaration of independence  But in a larger symbolic sense, the referendum result, narrow as it was    52% to 48%    demonstrated the potential of voters to wield a stunning shock to the political system that can shatter the logic and assumptions of conventional politics. There’s no guarantee that American voters will show the same kind of rebelliousness and willingness to leap into the unknown in November as a slim majority of Britons did on Thursday. And the U. S. system of    races and an electoral college could mitigate against some of the grassroots anger that exploded in a binary ”Leave” or ”Remain” vote in Britain. But events in Europe must trigger at least some concern among Democrats. Pollsters in the UK underestimated the fury of grassroots voters outside metropolitan areas in a way that could be mirrored in the United States, where Clinton now enjoys a lead in national surveys. Furthermore, ”Brexit” forces triumphed partly because the Labour Party could not deliver its traditional working class voters in some big   cities for the ”Remain” campaign, despite the support of party leaders. It is not a stretch to wonder whether the kind of political message that was so powerful in the referendum    featuring a harsh critique of free trade and a demands to ”take our country back”    could prove just as effective among   workers in rust belt states in the United States. Certainly, it’s a message that Trump has been hammering with success all election season and is at the center of his claims to be able to remake the U. S. electoral map. And the billionaire has consistently bested Clinton when voters are asked who is best equipped to handle the economy. The immediate stock market contagion unleashed by the referendum across the globe represented the worst equity carnage since the start of the Great Recession in 2008. If the losses prove   the impact of the referendum on the U. S. economy and politics could be temporary. But if ”Brexit” ushers in a period of economic volatility across Europe that begins to squelch growth, the U. S. economy could be badly affected    complicating Clinton’s bid to pull off the tough assignment of winning a third consecutive White House term for the Democrats. Trump would meanwhile seize on any slowdown in the U. S. precipitated by Brexit to argue that Obama’s economic management is a failure and it is time to try something new. But there are also warning signs for Trump. Though he was quick to claim a share of the credit for the British political earthquake    placing it in the context of a revolt against global elites in which he sees himself as a major player    a prolonged period of world turmoil could also work against the billionaire former reality star. Such an environment could bolster Clinton’s claims that a crisis is no time to choose a president who has no experience of governing and that her pedigree as a former secretary of state and relationships with leaders all over the world are a perfect fit for a perilous moment. The Democratic presumptive nominee made that argument in her statement: ”This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans’ pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.” Her campaign later issued a fundraising appeal with that message, writing, ”No matter what the collective wisdom of our political punditry has to say between now and November, Donald Trump has a real chance of winning this election.” Clinton’s campaign worked hard to demonstrate a contrast between Clinton and Trump as potential leaders in a time of crisis. The Clinton camp also sought to downplay similarities between the seething political scenes in the U. K. and the United States. ”It is important that we recognize that this American election is about what is happening here in America not what is happening in Yorkshire or in Cardiff,” said Clinton’s senior adviser Jake Sullivan on a conference call. Sullivan also rejected the idea that Clinton could find herself overtaken by a similar populist tide in November, saying she had spent months on the campaign trail and was intimately familiar with the difficulties facing many working Americans. RELATED: Trump hails Brexit, sees parallels to his campaign, The possible economic consequences of Brexit in the   could be dwarfed by the geopolitical shakeup that is now looming in the years to come. Britain’s referendum has already set off calls in Europe for similar separation votes in other Eurosceptic nations, threatening to dismantle the economic and political union that has been a pillar of transatlantic stability for 70 years and been a crucial partner for the United States. As the U. S. faces challenges to its power in Asia from a rising China and in Europe from a recalcitrant Russia and in the Middle East from a motley group of insurgent forces, Washington can hardly afford the splintering of its   of Western security. In addition, the referendum looks likely to result in the fracturing of America’s closest historic ally, the United Kingdom    a factor that could be a diplomatic nightmare for the next president. In the hours after the vote, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced plans to draft new legislation to allow a second independence referendum north of the border after   Scots narrowly voted to stay in the United Kingdom in 2014. Though a Scottish referendum may not take place for years, it will revive questions about a neutering of British military power and the fate of Britain’s   nuclear deterrent    which nationalists opposed and is part of NATO’s security infrastructure    that the next U. S. president will be forced to grapple with.\n",

      " (CNN) British citizens began frantically looking for ways to keep their European citizenship on Friday morning after a referendum on leaving the EU passed in a close vote. Google search data showed a spike in searches for ”getting an Irish passport” from the UK.  Citizens of European Union member states can travel freely across the continent right now. Any restrictions that may be placed on British travelers   will be dependent on negotiations between London and Brussels.   Irish passport laws, British citizens with Irish parents are entitled to hold Irish passports, and those with Irish grandparents can also apply.  Anyone born before 2005 in Northern Ireland, the only part of the United Kingdom that shares a land border with another country, is entitled to Irish citizenship, though there are some restrictions for those born after that date. Because of the increased number of inquiries, the Irish Passport Office in Dublin issued guidelines to those seeking information on Friday morning. Rush for citizenship, Leon Ward, a    from Cardiff in Wales, has an Irish dad. ”I am a citizen of the European Union, I voted to remain in the EU for peace, security, solidarity, unity, rights, free movement and prosperity,” he told CNN. ”The UK has decided it is better off alone, a decision I fundamentally disagree with. I want to remain a citizen of the EU for all the benefits that come with it.” Scott Edgar, a web developer who was born and raised in Northern Ireland but always held a British passport, said he picked up forms at his local post office in Belfast for himself, his brother, and his mother. He said that although he identifies culturally more with those in Northern Ireland than people in the Republic of Ireland, he is applying for an Irish passport to ensure he has the ability to travel and work abroad.  There were multiple reports on social media of post offices in Northern Ireland running out of Irish passport application forms. Eligible bachelors, It wasn’t all doom and gloom, however. Some Irish expats in London used the opportunity to let people know they were on the market. \n",

      "London (CNN) The United Kingdom’s historic Brexit vote to leave the European Union triggered the resignation Friday of British Prime Minister David Cameron and wreaked havoc on global markets. Go here to follow CNN’s coverage of the UK referendum live.  There was a mixture of jubilation and tearful disbelief in the UK as people awoke to the final result from Thursday’s extremely close vote, which deeply divided the nation. The result plunged Europe into uncertainty, with calls for further referendums from emboldened   groups who see it as a boost for their     policies. It also reverberated across financial markets, causing huge losses in Asia, Europe and the United States as traders weighed the consequences for the world’s biggest economic zone. Within hours of Thursday’s ballot outcome    51. 89% in favor of leaving the EU and 48. 11% against    Cameron delivered an emotionally charged statement outside the Prime Minister’s residence at 10 Downing Street, announcing his intention to stand down. MORE: What happens now? Cameron’s possible successor, ”The British people have voted to leave the EU and their will must be respected,” he said. ”The will of the British people is an instruction which must be delivered. . .. There can be no doubt about the result.” Cameron gave no timetable for his departure but said he wanted a new leader to be in place by October, when his Conservative Party holds its annual conference. He said the country needed a   leader to steer it out of the EU, an organization it has been a part of since 1973. That process could take at least two years. Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London who campaigned for the UK’s departure from the EU, is tipped by bookmakers as Cameron’s likely successor.  Johnson, who was greeted by a booing crowd when he left his home on Friday morning, thanked voters for their decision, pledged that the UK would remain committed to Europe and urged unity. ”I think the electorate have searched in their hearts and answered as honestly as they can,” he said. ”They have decided to vote to take back control from a European Union that has become too remote.” Former PM: There will be costs, Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer  that UK voters would learn over the next 24 months that leaving Europe will not solve their economic troubles, ease their apprehensions or make Britain more independent in a meaningful way. ”I literally cannot think of a big decision that I was not able to take because of Europe,” Blair said. ”There is so much anger at the moment that the anger replaces the more rational answers.” Blair noted that the United States was facing the same type of political fracturing, brought on by economic turmoil, globalization and anger at immigration.  ”Getting out of Europe is not the answer,” he said, noting the UK sells half of its goods and services to the EU. ”We are going to have to negotiate ourselves back into that market and it will be much more difficult than these people understand.” Possible Scottish independence vote, In Scotland, where support was overwhelmingly in favor of remaining in the EU, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister and leader of the dominant Scottish National Party, said the outcome threw into doubt the future of her country’s place in the UK. She said the Scottish government will begin preparing legislation for a new independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament decides it wants to hold one. Scots voted down a bid for independence from the UK in 2014. ”Democratically unacceptable,” said Sturgeon in describing the fact that Scotland would be pulled out of the European Union despite the majority of the Scottish people voting to stay in. MORE: What does Brexit mean for you? Sinn Fein calls for Irish unity, The Sinn Féin party in Northern Ireland called for a referendum on Irish unity, which could take Northern Ireland out of the UK and join it with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. Voters in Northern Ireland voted for the UK to remain in the EU. Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Brexit result could portend tougher border rules    with barriers and custom posts    between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, because it will be the only land border between the EU and the UK. Adams said such a result would be unacceptable given the vote result in Northern Ireland and could undermine the cooperative relationships and that have developed between the two Irelands since the Good Friday agreement. ”My issue is the north of Ireland is going to be dragged out of the EU on the decision made by people on another island,” said Adams, whose political party is dedicated to the reunification of Ireland. ”We’re calling for a poll, a referendum, on Irish unity, on the border. This (the Brexit vote) has the potential to set back the good work that’s been done in terms of the peace process, building harmony, building infrastructure.” ’Dying’ institution, As European leaders faced their own crises, German Chancellor Angela Merkel stressed the ”need to make sure that European people feel that the EU wants to improve all our lives.” She said she greatly regretted the UK’s decision, but added, ”The EU is strong enough to find the right answers today.” French President Francois Hollande called it a ”painful choice which I deeply regret for the UK and Europe.” Italy’s finance minister, Pier Carlo Padoan, warned of a domino effect amid calls for further exit votes.   Dutch politician Geert Wilders congratulated the UK on its decision and called for a Dutch referendum on EU membership.  ”We want to be in charge of our own country, our own money, our own borders and our own immigration policy,” he was quoted as saying in a statement on his website. Marine Le Pen, the leader of France’s National Front party who plans to run for the French presidency next year, also congratulated the Brexit side. Her party has suggested the French will also hold an ”out” referendum if she assumes the presidency. Passions continued to run high in the UK in the hours after the vote, with UK Independence Party (UKIP) leader and Leave campaigner Nigel Farage declaring the EU a ”dying” institution. ”We’ve given ourselves the chance to rejoin the world,” he told journalists. ”June 23rd needs to become a national bank holiday and we will call it Independence Day.” U. S. President Barack Obama said that while the UK’s relationship with Europe was changing, the ties that bound the UK to the United States and the United States to Europe would remain. ”I do think yesterday’s vote speaks to ongoing changes and challenges that are raised by globalization, but the UK’s relationship with the EU will change. What will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” Obama said. ”That will endure. And the EU will remain one of our indispensable partners.” MORE: Full coverage of the UK referendum, NATO: UK will stay a strong ally, NATO   Jens Stoltenberg voiced reassurances that the United Kingdom will remain a strong and committed NATO ally despite the vote. ”Today, as we face more instability and uncertainty, NATO is more important than ever as a platform for cooperation among European allies and between Europe and North America,” said Stoltenberg. ”A strong, united and determined NATO remains an essential pillar of stability in a turbulent world and a key contributor to international peace and security.” Voters react, The referendum followed one of the most divisive political campaigns in recent memory. Polls consistently showed voters split down the middle, with the outcome too close to call ahead of the vote. News of the decision sparked strong emotions, with those in favor and those against reflecting on a campaign marred by allegations of lies, distrust and hate. ”This is so sad,” said Daniel Trilling on Twitter. ”Millions of people aren’t going to feel any more in control of their lives or their country because of this vote.” ”People vote on emotion,” Twitter user @cemanthe posted. ”This was won on false promises and emotive texts about immigration. Not on facts.” ”I am SO happy this morning,” wrote another, Gemma.  An online petition calling for a second referendum gathered more than 120, 000 signatures within hours of being posted.  Leading political figures gave mixed reactions.  Tony Blair, the former UK prime minister, called the decision a divided result. ”It’s going to be a complicated process but it’s important to bring our country together and stabilize our country,” he told CNN’s Becky Anderson. ”It’s still a resilient country and it’s a strong country.” Sadiq Khan, the mayor of largely   London, said the decision was a ”clear message” and urged calm. ’Taking back control’ European Council President Donald Tusk said the decision was ”historic, but not a moment for hysterical reactions.” Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee in the U. S. presidential election, hailed the UK’s decision to ”reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy.” In a news conference Friday as he attended the official opening of a remodeled golf resort bearing his name in Turnberry, Scotland, Trump called the decision of the voters ”a great thing.” ”They’re angry over borders, they’re angry over people coming into the country and taking over. Nobody even knows who they are,” he said. ”They’re angry about many, many things. They took back control of their country.” UKIP’s Farage told CNN’s Nima Elbagir that the economic fears in the wake of the EU departure were overstated, and that he expected an even better relationship with the United States. He said the vote was a repudiation of bullying tactics by corporate and political powers to keep the UK in the EU. ”(We were) threatened by everybody that if we didn’t stay part of this political union, dreadful things would happen to us, and what happened were the little people, the regular people, the ordinary people said, ’No, this is wrong,’” Farage said. ”When you really think about it, what we’ve done isn’t actually that radical. . .. We want to be a democratic nation. We want to make our own laws in our own parliament, have our own supreme court, and control our own border. If you think about, there’s now 183 countries around the world that have independence days. What we did yesterday was become 184th.” Opinion: Why Brexit vote should worry Trump, Markets plunge, The effects of the vote outcome were immediately felt in markets and economies around the world. In New York, the Dow ended the day down more than 611 points, to close at 17, 399. London’s FTSE index shed $164 billion of its value in the first 10 minutes of trading, but regained ground later in the day.  The NASDAQ index fell more than 4% and into a correction, or down 10% from recent highs. The British pound at one point plunged more than 12% to below $1. 34, its lowest level since 1985. Japan’s Nikkei tanked 6. 7% and Hong Kong’s main index dropped 3. 7%.  Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said the body is ”well prepared” and ”won’t hesitate” to take additional measures as markets adjust. The ”UK financial system is resilient,” he added. \n",

      " (CNN) If history casts UK Prime Minister David Cameron in the villain role following Britain’s exit from the European Union, then Nigel Farage may well be remembered as the puppet master in the wings.  As it became clear that more than half of the nearly 33 million referendum voters had cast their ballots to leave the EU, Farage     the leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP)    declared it a ”victory for real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.” It was a sudden return to prominence for Farage, who was not part of the official Leave campaign but had certainly been on the sidelines, fanning the flames of revolt among the Eurosceptics in Cameron’s party.  Cameron falls on his sword, ”Let’s stop pretending what this European project is,” the UKIP leader said in his last speech before Thursday’s vote. ”They have an anthem, they are building an army, they’ve already got their own police force and of course they’ve got a flag.” So who is Nigel Farage? For many years Farage has operated on the political fringes    ironically, as a member of the European Parliament    campaigning against the EU and its looming shadow over British sovereignty.  A former Conservative, he left the party in 1992 after Britain signed the Maastricht Treaty, which led to the creation of the European Union and its common currency, the euro. He became a founding member of UKIP, which opposed Maastricht and had a mandate to move Britain away from Europe.   But neither he nor his party have enjoyed particular success in mainstream British politics. UKIP currently has only one lawmaker in parliament    he failed to win a seat in the 2010 and 2015 general elections    and more often than not, Farage has found himself ridiculed and ostracized as a political eccentric. At one point he was more likely to be seen on satirical British TV show ”Have I got news for you.” Brexit: Calls for calm, He almost stepped away from politics after offering to resign as UKIP leader after the 2015 election, but party members urged him to stay on.  The party actually increased its share of the national vote but found themselves with only one parliamentary seat due to the UK’s ”   ” voting system. Why is he controversial? With his bullish and ”blokey” style, Farage’s comments have long been manna from heaven for headlines writers. He once revealed that he feels ”awkward” on London trains because he only hears foreign languages being spoken.  ”The fact that in scores of our cities and market towns, this country in a short space of time has frankly become unrecognizable,” he was quoted by London’s Evening Standard as saying.  Divided kingdom: Look at this map! ”Whether it is the impact on local schools and hospitals, whether it is the fact in many parts of England you don’t hear English spoken any more. This is not the kind of community we want to leave to our children and grandchildren.” But many critics look past his ebullient demeanor, accusing him of peddling racist and xenophobic views    especially when it comes to his ”pet project,” immigration.  Farage believes Britain’s open immigration policy agreed with the EU has led to an influx of people that have damaged cohesion and created divisions within society. ”We find ourselves, for the benefit of   trade, having to accept unlimited free movement of people,” he said earlier this month. Farage also unveiled a campaign poster before the vote with the words ”Breaking Point. The EU has failed us all,” showing an image of migrants entering Europe last year. Opposition politicians dismissed it as ”divisive” and ” .” His ’Brexit’ triumph?  Friday, June 24 will undoubtedly go down as a personal victory for Farage.  His views on immigration clearly hit home with a large number of people in Britain, who fear growing migration levels threaten to overwhelm already stretched health and housing services in the UK. Brexit: What does it mean for you? In an interview with CNN Friday, Farage said: ”I was written off as being a lunatic, and politically the support for this was absolutely tiny. So when we got to 10 o’clock last night I almost dared not to hope that what I’ve dreamed of would happen. But it did! That little idea was considered a little kooky, and 17 million voted for it yesterday and I couldn’t be happier.” But he warned that the vote will not be in vain. ”The first thing that happens is I lead the biggest British delegation in Europe in parliament, he told CNN. ”We’re going to watch these negotiations like a hawk to make sure it’s done properly. UKIP needs to stay strong to make sure the government actually carries out the wishes of the people. We’ve won the vote to become an independent nation. We now need to make sure it does actually happen. What just happened    and what could be next? ”So even if they [the EU] try to buy us off with a little concession, what we’ve voted for is very very clear. We’ve voted to make our laws, run our own country, control our own borders.” What about the 48% who voted to remain? He struck a conciliatory tone. ”I’d say to them ’listen, our trading relationship today is exactly the same as it was yesterday. What we now have is a period of transition, with which we can get a sensible deal with our European neighbors.’ The exciting thing is we can do more globally. We are going to be better off as a result of this. Don’t worry.”\n",

      " (CNN) While America slept and Asia worked, the shape of Europe changed.  UK voters decided they wanted out of the European Union, triggering international shock and concern. World markets switched to crisis mode, with the Dow plunging more than 600 points Friday and the value of the pound falling to a   .  Here’s the rundown:  UK voted to get out of the EU: The final vote came to 51. 89% for LEAVE and 48. 11% for REMAIN.  How the heck did that happen? The final results map highlights a telling split between London and the rest of England and Wales. Here’s how each region voted.  British Prime Minister David Cameron resigned: He campaigned for the British to stay in the EU. Obviously that didn’t work. So he announced that a new leader should be in charge by early October. His speech here, So who’s going to lead Britain now? Although nothing is set in stone, former London Mayor Boris Johnson is a serious contender to succeed Cameron.  Brexit vote results create turmoil in Britain: Four senior opposition Labour Party members of Parliament resigned from Labour’s shadow Cabinet and a fifth was sacked in the wake of Thursday’s referendum and they’re calling for new leadership but party leader Jeremy Corbyn won’t resign.  World leaders are divided on the news: British officials have expressed concern over the uncertainty that’s sure to follow the decision. Across the pond, presumptive U. S. presidential nominee Donald Trump called Brexit ”great.” Other European leaders were relatively silent preceding the vote. Petition calling for second EU vote:  More than 3 million people signed an online petition calling for a second referendum on whether Britain should leave the EU. Coincidentally, its creator has sought to distance himself from the petition because he is a Leave voter.  Public figures and regular people alike are reacting passionately: There seem to be a lot of British celebrities who are upset about the news, but there will always be differing opinions.    Markets are hemorrhaging: Stocks across the globe got hammered amid the panic. Both the pound (now at its lowest level since 1985) and the euro have plunged.  Here’s why it matters: The UK is the world’s fifth biggest economy and any slowdown will hurt the anemic global growth.  It’s going to take about two years for the divorce proceedings: The UK is so intricately entwined with the EU, it could even take longer than that. What happens then? Much like a real divorce, it depends on whether the parties decide to split amicably, or through strife and diplomatic conflict.  What does the Brexit mean for you? That depends on who you are. What does the decision mean for Europe? The UK is the first to leave the European Union, and experts say its exit will be sorely felt by the rest of the EU. \n",

Here is : ’ ’   ”The question facing British voters on Thursday is just a   specific, local version of a question being considered by voters   all over the advanced world: Should we vent our rage at the   institutions we are dissatisfied with by replacing them with some   unspecified,   replacement?” ’ ’    ’ ’ 2243   THE RACE TO BE THE FIRST COUNT TO DECLARE IS   ON ’ ’   Counting has now begun, and two counts in the North East of   England are battling it out to be the first to declare their   results.

EU Can’t Always Get What You Want: The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union on Thursday night, delivering a seismic blow to European integration, Britain’s territorial integrity, and the global economy. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he would resign by October after the national referendum, in which 52 percent of voters opted to leave the   bloc. Brexit’s Blowback: Stock markets fell across the globe on Friday in response to the vote, with Japan’s Nikkei shedding 10 percent of its value and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging over 600 points. The effects hit the U. K. hardest: Britain’s pound sterling dropped to its lowest value since 1985 and London’s FTSE fell 3. 2 percent. Trump’s Trip: Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump praised the U. K.’s flight from the EU while visiting his Scottish resort on Friday. “I think it’s a great thing that happened,” the beleaguered candidate told reporters Friday, adding that it could be good for him personally. “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly,” he said, referring to his golf course. “What’s happening now is a powerful countervailing force where people are saying, ‘Stop the world, I want to get off it. I want to return to previous certainties. ’”  —  Mark Leonard, who studies European policy, on Brexit, “So it is almost certain unless something dramatic changes, 25 percent of Puerto Rico is going to get Zika. ”  —  Anthony Fauci, an immunologist  “A reason you see all the time, but virtually nobody mentions when they’re defending the legality of assault weapons after a mass shooting, is that they’re a whole lot of fun to shoot. ”  —  Robert Spitzer, a political science professor, Emily Anderson on how Laura Ingalls Wilder shaped her: Instead of following Oprah or Sheryl Sandberg, I have —  for better and worse —  heeded the stoic wisdom of Wilder, who writes in Little Town on the Prairie that “  people must never let feelings be shown by voice or manner. ” In other words: I’m   I secretly pursue my own agenda, and —  the greatest of   sins —  I hide my feelings. As an adult, I’m baffled by the stars of reality dating shows like The Bachelor, less by their appetite for public scrutiny than by their fluency in an emotional vernacular that feels both evangelical and alien. Over candlelit dinners, contestants confess their love and relate traumatic stories in order to prove they’re “ready to open up and be vulnerable. ” While Little House and The Bachelor are forms of   fiction, autobiographical works like the former are usually associated with  . But across eight volumes and hundreds of pages, Wilder and her characters repeatedly tout the dangers of sharing your feelings.

If the correct answer is five (which it is, because I invited the president of something other than the United States) that means that the Oxford comma created confusion that could have been avoided if I’d omitted it. “I invited the president, Barack Obama and three of my friends” clearly indicates that Barack Obama and the president, in this context, are separate people.

David Cameron Was a Historic and Disastrous FailureAlex Massie | Foreign Policy“A year ago, Cameron didn’t even expect he would have to honor his party’s platform promise to hold a referendum on EU membership. But that was before he won a surprising majority in last year’s general election. Suddenly he found himself trapped by his own manifesto promises  —   promises made to placate the Euroskeptics in his own party and see off the threat posed to his right flank by the virulently   UK Independence Party. A referendum would have to be held. ” * * * The Prosecutor and the PresidentJames Verini | The New York Times“Though Kenya is among the most developed places in Africa, for two months, death and torture were meted out with machete, club and knife. People were dismembered,   burned alive in homes and churches. Many men were, like Eric, forcibly circumcised. Kenya was brought to the brink of civil war.   …     In 2010, the International Criminal Court, the   tribunal created in 1998 to try the worst atrocities on earth —  war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide —  announced plans to charge six Kenyans for orchestrating the postelection violence. The most important suspect was Uhuru Kenyatta the son of Kenya’s first president, Jomo Kenyatta, he was considered by many Kikuyu to be their natural leader. ” * * * The Ghosts of Fukushima Steve Featherstone | The New Republic“Hisao Yanai, a     retired yakuza boss, stands alone behind the bar at Ippei, the restaurant he owns in the Japanese town of Naraha. There are no customers today. The streets outside the restaurant are deserted. Five years ago, on March 11, 2011, a powerful earthquake and tsunami triggered a triple meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, located ten miles north of Naraha, forcing the evacuation of roughly 160, 000 people. Half of them still cannot go home. Last fall, Naraha became the first town in Fukushima’s mandatory evacuation zone to reopen fully, allowing all 7, 400 residents to return. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before. Could a town despoiled by radiation be summoned back to life?” * * * Why Women Will Suffer If Britain Leaves the European UnionLinda Yang | Broadly“No one can accurately forecast what Britain will look like if it leaves the EU, but women may find themselves on the brutal receiving end of Brexit. ‘I think it’s highly likely that if the UK leaves the EU it will result in a much more conservative administration being put into place. In that context, they will be hostile to equality law,’ said Christopher McCrudden, a professor of human rights and equality law at Queen’s University Belfast. ” * * * ‘We Are Desperate’: Iraqis Flee Fallujah, Only to Find Another NightmareLoveday Morris | Washington Post“‘I wish a mortar shell had landed on my house in Fallujah and killed me,’ added Ismail Mohammed Hussein, 51. ‘It’s better than living like this. ’” * * * Italy Senators Call for   Qualification BBC via Rai News“Under the proposals, ‘aspiring pizzaioli’ would have to pass a theoretical and practical exam after undertaking practical training, food science and hygiene modules, and   study —  at least half in English.

      ", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors.  —  In a historic vote, the United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union by a      margin, according to forecasts from the BBC, ITV, and others.  —  Prime Minister David Cameron says he will step down by October.  —  The stunning move raises major questions not only about how the U. K. will extricate itself from the   bloc and the relationship it will have with it, but also about the country itself, and of the EU,   War II Europe’s most ambitious political experiment.  —  Polls were tight ahead of Thursday’s referendum, but as the votes rolled in, the “leave” side performed better than expected in places it was supposed to win and triumphed in locations it was not. The “remain” side, despite the establishment’s optimism, could never catch up.  —  The pound slid to a   low against the dollar on the news, and stocks are sharply lower, as are Dow futures.  —  We’re   the events as they happen, and you can read how it all unfolded below. All updates are in Eastern Standard Time (GMT  ). 3:34 p. m. While the world —  and certainly its financial markets —  are acting as if the sky has fallen on its head, the German Foreign Office provides some perspective on its Twitter feed: We are off now to an Irish pub to get decently drunk. And from tomorrow on we will again work for a better #Europe! Promised! #EURef 🇪🇺  3:11 p. m. President Obama said he’d spoken to David Cameron and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, about the results of the referendum. “I do think that yesterday’s vote speaks to the ongoing changes and challenges raised by globalization, but while the U. K.’s relationship with the EU will change, one thing that will not change is the special relationship that exists between our two nations,” he said. “That will endure. ” You can watch his comments here: Speaking at #GES2016, @POTUS offers a statement on yesterday’s UK referendum to leave the European Union. https:  .  Merkel, speaking in Berlin, said of the results: “There’s no way around it: Today is a watershed for Europe and the European unity process. ” She also appealed for patience in Europe, saying its leaders must “calmly and prudently analyze and evaluate the situation. ” Merkel hosts talks Monday with the leaders of France, Italy, and the EC. 12:12 p. m.  Nigel Farage, leader of the   U. K. Independence Party or UKIP, told Susanna Reid of the morning show Good Morning Britain that a key promise made by the Leave campaign was a mistake. In its advertisements, the Leave campaign had claimed that the U. K. sent 350 million pounds a week to the European Union, and promised that in the event of an exit the money would come home —  specifically to fund the National Health Service. (That figure was an exaggeration). Reid asked Farage whether he could guarantee that outcome now that the vote was over his response was, “No, I can’t, and I would never have made that claim, and that was one of the mistakes I think that the Leave campaign made. ” (Farage campaigned for Brexit but was not part of the official Leave campaign, which he said “ostracized” him.) Reid followed up incredulously: “That’s why many people have voted. . .. You’re saying, after 17 million people have voted for Leave, based —  I don’t know how many people voted on the basis of that advert but that was a huge part of the propaganda —  you’re now saying that’s a mistake?” Watch the exchange here: WATCH: @Nigel_Farage tells @susannareid100 it was a ’mistake’ for Leave to claim there’d be £350M a week for NHShttps:  .  11:39 a. m. Stocks in London, which at one point were down 7 percent, somewhat recovered to close down 2. 7 percent. 11 a. m. Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister who last night called the result of the Brexit vote “beyond comprehension,” highlights the demographics of the voter preferences. Young voters, particularly     favored remaining in the EU by large margins in a YouGov poll taken before the referendum older voters tended to feel the opposite. (Though it’s worth noting that YouGov’s final poll before results were announced showed Remain in the lead, which in the end was not to be.) But opinion polls on the actual outcome were in a statistical dead heat before final results were announced the margins of the age gap in voting preferences are far more convincing. And here’s how Bildt, at any rate, interprets that finding: This is it: Old England has deprived young Britain of its European future. pic. twitter.  10:36 a. m.

It’s going to be a long day on Wall Street. The U. S. stock exchanges just opened, and as expected, they’re taking a shellacking.

JUST IN: Dow plunges nearly 400 points in first minute of trading https:  .  https:  .  9:26 a. m. President Obama, who had championed Britain’s continued membership in the EU, has weighed in this morning. Here’s his full statement: The people of the United Kingdom have spoken, and we respect their decision.  The special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom is enduring, and the United Kingdom’s membership in NATO remains a vital cornerstone of U. S. foreign, security, and economic policy.  So too is our relationship with the European Union, which has done so much to promote stability, stimulate economic growth, and foster the spread of democratic values and ideals across the continent and beyond.  The United Kingdom and the European Union will remain indispensable partners of the United States even as they begin negotiating their ongoing relationship to ensure continued stability, security, and prosperity for Europe, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the world. Obama had famously said Britain would go to the “back of the queue” on trade negotiations with the U. S. in case of a Brexit. 8:34 a. m. Global financial markets are reacting exactly as you’d expect them to this morning: They’re plummeting. Here’s a summary: #Brexit market reax:Dow ⬇️ 510 pointsFTSE ⬇️ 4. 5%Nikkei ⬇️ 7. 9%Oil ⬇️ 4. 9%Gold ⬆️ 4. 7%https:  .  pic. twitter.  Gold, a safe haven at times of instability, has soared to a more than   high. 6:40 a. m. ET, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is saying the possibility of another Scottish referendum on independence from the U. K. is “highly likely. ” Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. “Its a statement of the obvious that a second referendum is on the table,” she told the BBC in an interview.   Scots narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 2014. 6:17 a. m. ET, Boris Johnson, the man who led the “leave” campaign, said: “We cannot turn our backs on Europe, we are part of Europe. ” He also described Cameron as one “of the most extraordinary politicians of our age. ” But, he said of the EU: “It was a noble idea for its time, it is no longer right for this country. ” Johnson is widely tipped to succeed Cameron as British prime minister. Meanwhile, a joint statement from the EU says: “ We regret this decision but respect it. ”   We now expect the United Kingdom government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. Updated on June 24 at 6:06 a. m. Prime Minister David Cameron says “fresh leadership” is needed in the U. K. but he will stay in office until October to “steady the ship. ” He said a new prime minister would have to negotiate with the EU on what Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc will look like. His full speech   The British decision has had ripple effects, as expected, in the financial markets. Here’s a summary, via Bloomberg: A quick guide to #Brexit and beyond, after Britain votes to quit EU https:  .  pic. twitter.  Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, has weighed in, as well: Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote. They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games! Trump had supported Britain’s departure from the EU. Scotland, of course, voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, and SNP leaders have said a referendum is on the table to split from the U. K. June 23 at 11:45 p. m. The BBC and other British news networks are calling it: the United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union. BBC forecasts UK votes to #Leave the European Unionhttps:  .  #EURef #Brexit pic. twitter.  11:42 p. m. Northern Ireland, where the 1998 Good Friday Agreement ended the Troubles, voted to remain in the EU, but the vote there reflected the historic divisions between Catholics and Protestants. Indeed, Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, and a former senior IRA member, said in March if Britain leaves the EU, Northern Ireland should get its own vote on union with the Republic of Ireland. As you would expect, the Democratic Unionist Party, which mostly represents Protestants, says Northern Ireland’s future is now as ”bright as the rest of the U. K.” Former President Clinton had urged British voters to stay in the EU, saying leaving would imperil the Good Friday agreement. 11:30 p. m. A victory for the leave campaign also raises questions about Scotland’s future in the U. K. The Scots, who narrowly voted in 2014 to remain in the U. K. have broadly voted to remain in the EU. Nicola Sturgeon, the head of the Scottish National Party, told the Guardian this week that if the U. K. voted to leave, ”there will be things I’ll want to do very quickly to assert our ability to have a direct voice both with the U. K. government and with Europe.” The SNP manifesto, she pointed out, says the Scottish Parliament can call for another referendum on independence under such circumstances. 11:23 p. m. The British pound is cratering right now, dropping to   lows against the U. S. dollar as a departure from the European Union looks increasingly likely. From Bloomberg: The 8. 5 percent plunge on Friday leaves the currency on course for its worst day on record, and compares with the 4. 1 percent drop on 1992’s Black Wednesday, when the pound was forced out of Europe’s   mechanism —  the previous biggest daily drop. The pound’s   intraday decline has already been surpassed   with a 9. 5 percent drop on Friday beating a 5. 9 percent decline on Oct. 24, 2008 —  when stock markets crashed around the world during the Great Financial Crisis. 11:15 p. m. With Britain’s exit from the EU looking increasingly likely, politicians and political commentators are speculating about the fate of David Cameron. The Conservative prime minister had strongly backed the U. K.’s continued membership in the EU, but the potential loss in the referendum, as well as the dramatic impact that possibility is having on the British currency and stock futures, is prompting speculation of his resignation   fresh elections. I’m in shock. David Cameron’s gamble has failed. His career is over. Will the Commons sit on Saturday? Is Boris Johnson really up to it? 11:13 p. m. Nigel Farage, the leader of the United Kingdom Independence Party, told supporters at the leave campaign’s headquarters, ”Dare to dream, I think dawn is breaking on an independent United Kingdom.” He added that June 23 will be go down in British history as ”our independence day.” He then repeated his optimism on Twitter: I now dare to dream that the dawn is coming up on an independent United Kingdom. 11:06 p. m. Many votes are still waiting to be counted, but the Independent’s 3 AM front page for Friday is inching towards acknowledging a leave victory.

The leave campaign is leading in England and Wales while the remain campaign is winning in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Here’s what that looks like. This map shows how the nation has voted so far #EURefResults pic. twitter.  It’s worth noting that not all the results from the southeast, home to London, are in yet. That area is expected to vote to remain in the EU, though it’s unclear if there will be enough votes to close the gap. 10:40 p. m. ITV News is now predicting an 80 percent probability of a victory for the leave campaign. Meanwhile, leave has taken a lead nationwide: State of play at 3. 30am, with 164 results in. #EURefResults pic. twitter.  10:35 p. m. The effect of a possible leave victory is roiling the pound, which is down 6 percent.

This is a huge loss for the remain side, as the city was a bastion of the Labour party. 10:24 p. m. The Press Association still has the two sides neck and neck, at 3 a. m. GMT (10 p. m. ET): It’s remarkably close with 100 areas of 382 areas declared #EURefResults https:  .  But the BBC is quoting John Curtice, the polling expert, as saying the leave campaign is the favorite to win. 10:06 p. m. The remain side was boosted by its performance in Wandsworth, the London borough. It performed much better than expected, winning 75 percent to 25 percent, with a 72 percent turnout. Wandsworth result now in 118, 463 remain, 39, 421 leave #EURefResults pic. twitter.  9:57 p. m. However tonight ends, the vote is going to be extremely close. That’s possibly why British politicians are making it a point to say they will start listening to the electorate. John Mann, a Labour MP, says the party is “out of touch” on issues like immigration, prompting many of its traditional voters to vote leave. EU membership allows citizens of member states to freely settle and work in any of the bloc’s 28 countries. That can be a boon if you’re a   but not so much if you’ve had your wages undercut. Indeed, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, says he doesn’t think Labour has “been listening enough” to its supporters.  If you’re wondering why we’re focusing on Labour voters, it’s because the party’s members are mostly supportive of EU membership. This isn’t true of the ruling Conservatives, who have a large   bloc —  even if David Cameron, the prime minister, has championed the remain side. 9:45 p. m. The Press Association reports that the remain side now has a slight lead over leave. The state of play at 2. 30am. #EURefResults pic. twitter.  It’s important to point out that this is still early in the counting phase. Indeed, the BBC has lower numbers, and has the leave side leading: 1, 292, 762 votes versus 1, 144, 509 votes. 9:35 p. m. The Remain side appears to be performing better than expected in their stronghold London, but is it too late? Large numbers for Remain in the London boroughs may just give them the edge. Whether it’s too late is yet to be seen. But in Wales, the leave side is performing well. In Scotland and Northern Ireland, the remain side is expected to win. 9:30 p. m.

Kate Hoey, another party member, said Labour risks losing many of their traditional voters because of its   position. Hoey, who backs leave, told Sky News: We will find thousands and thousands of Labour supporters abandoning the Labour view on this because we’ve known for a long time, being out there, that Labour supporters, the Labour Party view on this, is out of step with Labour supporters and   supporters, who I’m afraid we’ll probably find will not come back to us after the way the leadership have fought this campaign of staying in. 8:35 p. m.

      "   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. In 2005, Mark Leonard published a book called Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century. The moment was ripe for such an argument. The European Union had just embarked on the greatest expansion in its history, welcoming 10 new members, and headlines heralded the sprouting of “a European identity” and the emergence of a “United States of Europe. ” Heck, Greece even admitted that it had fudged economic data in its zeal to join the European currency union. In the book, Leonard took issue with the notion that China or India could soon eclipse America as a world power. “Those countries suffer from the same problems as the United States: they are large, nationalistic nation states in an era of globalisation,” he wrote. “The European Union is leading a revolutionary transformation of the nature of power that in just 50 years has transformed a continent from total war to perpetual peace. By building a network of power —  that binds states together with a market, common institutions, and international law —  rather than a hierarchical   it is increasingly writing the rules for the 21st Century. ” Why Britain Left, On Friday morning, shortly after Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union, Leonard struck a starkly different tone. For the EU, Britain’s exit, or “Brexit,” risks “reinforcing a cycle of disintegration,” he wrote. “Member states like Poland and Hungary, as well as opposition parties like Marine Le Pen’s Front National [in France] could launch   moves.   …     If other crises —  a euro [currency] crisis, a Schengen [  movement] crisis, a Trump presidency —  get layered on top of Brexit, there is a real danger of collapse. ” How, in just 10 years, did we go from the European Century to European Collapse? Leonard, the   director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, is one of the closest and most thoughtful observers of Britain’s complex relationship with Europe. On Friday, after a sleepless night of tracking the   vote, he spoke with me about what went wrong with the European project, what’s behind Britain’s exit, and what comes next. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation follows. Uri Friedman: In 2005, you wrote a book called Why Europe Will Run the 21st Century in which you argued that the continent’s collective soft power could prove the model of the future. What went wrong? Mark Leonard: After 1989, [with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War] an incredible period of history was launched with Europeans bang in the center of it. It gave rise to a sense that the euro was reshaping the world. If you compare the map of Europe in 1989 to the map of Europe when I wrote my book in 2005, it’s unrecognizable. Lots of new states were created, countries that were in the Soviet bloc had become liberal democracies and joined the European Union. Around all of these different waves of countries that join the European Union, you have another wave of countries that seemed to be inspired by it —  you have the Orange Revolution in Ukraine and the Rose Revolution in Georgia. There were people taking to the streets, banging at the door of the EU and asking to be let in. And then you also have, at a global level, a new set of institutions being shaped that embodied the kind of   European way of working, like the World Trade Organization and the Kyoto Protocol and the International Criminal Court. The fourth way that I saw Europe changing the world was by setting off a regional domino effect. You had other regions coming together and modeling themselves off the European Union: the African Union, ASEAN, MERCOSUR. On every continent, there seemed to be an attempt to create a regional support club that was not identical to the EU, but was at least inspired by it. Those things collectively led to a sense that Europe was remaking the world in its image and exporting its values. One of the troubling things about the world of 2016 is that most Europeans feel that the world around them is in a state of chaos and that it’s the world that is transforming them —  [for example] through the Arab uprisings going wrong, which means that Europe’s neighbors are not importing democracy and European values, but exporting refugees and chaos. One of the central parts of my story was about how the EU seemed to be remaking Turkey —  now it’s Turkey that dictates the terms of trade by threatening to send refugees into the EU. At a global level, a lot of the institutions that seemed to be becoming increasingly important have been gridlocked by geopolitical competition. Therefore, the basic mindset of Europeans has changed. Instead of thinking about the EU as a universal project, which would change everyone else, they’re starting to think about the EU as a fragile, exceptional project that needs to be defended from others. These changes to the external environment have come at a time when, domestically, a lot of countries have been under a lot of economic pressure with the [European economic] crisis, even in countries like Britain that were very affected by the [2008] global financial crisis and introduced [government budget] austerity as a result. One of the other consequences of 1989, of [EU] enlargement, was that you get these large flows of people. That is another way that people think that they are being shaped —  that they’re becoming minorities in their own countries and there are people coming in and changing the nature of the country. That’s one of the slogans here: “I want my country back. ” Some of these [trends] are just cyclical, but when you make a decision like the decision that the British public took yesterday, it’s quite difficult to overturn. Your cycle can become a structural change quite easily, if it becomes enshrined by a referendum. The other element I didn’t predict [in 2005] was the collapse of representative democracy, which is happening everywhere. We’re seeing all elites in all developed countries going through this crisis. In a lot of countries like the U. S. with [Donald] Trump, it’s kind of contained, whereas in the U. K. in the EU, because countries are interdependent, it can actually start to undermine the EU. And that’s one of the dangers now —  that after a cycle of integration and of optimism, we’re in the midst of a cycle of disintegration and pessimism. These things can become  . Friedman: What does the Brexit vote means for the future of the European Union? How much should we think of this as, “Britain was never integrated into the European currency union, it was always a bit standoffish with the EU, this was inevitable,” versus how much should we think that the European project itself is existentially threatened? Leonard: The EU’s not going to disappear. But there are two dangers. One is of contagion —  that this [vote] could set off a spiral of disintegration with other countries [taking] copycat [actions]. And because it comes on the back of big things that Europeans are dealing with —  the rest of the euro crisis and the refugee crisis —  you have a structure that’s already under some pressure. The other [danger] is about the death of a certain idea of Europe, and that’s what my book was about. It was the idea that Europe could actually hope to have an effect on how the world was ordered. You’d have a European voice alongside other great powers. That’s more difficult to do if you don’t have a British component to the European project, because Britain is one of the countries that takes foreign policy seriously, that had a more global outlook, that had some sort of ambition to shape things. A Europe without Britain is poorer and smaller and maybe a bit less able to play that sort of role. Friedman: How would you characterize this moment in the modern history of Europe? Leonard: It’s a counterrevolutionary moment. My book essentially was a description of a revolution in how power and politics was organized. It was an expression of that revolutionary ambition —  where the laws of international relations were being rewritten. What’s happening now is a powerful countervailing force where people are saying, “Stop the world, I want to get off it. I want to return to previous certainties. ” And their language is of independence rather than of interdependence. It’s about trying to row back these profound changes that have been unleashed by the European project since the end of the Cold War. Friedman: You supported Britain remaining in the EU, right? Leonard: Yeah. Friedman: Are you British or European? How do you think of your own identity within the U. K. and Europe? Leonard: I’m very European. My mom comes from a German Jewish family. She was born in hiding in France in 1944 and then moved back to Germany in 1950 with her sister and her mother, and her father stayed in France. My dad’s British, but his life was very marked by the European experience as well. He was evacuated as an    —  separated from his parents during the Blitz. His father fought in the First World War and was gassed in the trenches. His outlook is very shaped by European mores. I lived in Brussels for 12 years as a kid as well. I have a very strong European heritage, which was shaped by the big historical events of the 20th century. But I also do feel incredibly comfortable in Britain. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the meaning of Britain and Britishness, and trying to understand this strange mix of being an island, but having a global worldview —  links to the rest of the world and the silently revolutionary qualities of Britishness: the creativity, the hybridity, the mongrel nation that Britain has become. That’s one of the other things that was being contested in this referendum, I think. Friedman: Given your family background, your past work, what does this vote mean to you personally? How did you feel when you woke up this morning? Leonard: Well, I didn’t. I stayed up all night. It’s a real shock because the referendum showed how fundamentally Britain is divided. It was a very close referendum: 52 percent voted [to leave the EU] 48 percent voted [to remain]. People have talked about how it showed that there isn’t one country anymore: You’ve got Remainia and Leavia, the country of [slain “Remain” lawmaker] Jo Cox and [“Leave” leader] Nigel Farage. If you look at where I live in London, 80 percent of people voted to stay in. If you go to other neighborhoods on the south coast or in   towns in the north of England, you have the opposite result. It’s a clear generational division as well.   of young people under the age of 25 voted to stay in it was almost a mirror image for [those older than] 75. You’ve got a profound division between two different ways of thinking about the national story. Friedman: What does this mean for the future of the United Kingdom? Northern Ireland will now share a border with an EU country, Ireland Scotland whose citizens largely wanted to remain in the EU, will likely stage a new independence referendum Spain now wants to seize control of Gibraltar. Was this, in a way, a vote to dissolve Great Britain? Leonard: I hope that wasn’t what was behind the Leave campaign, but there is a very real danger [of that occurring]. Friedman: What do you think tilted the balance in favor of Brexit? Some people say it was all about the economy. Some people say it was all about immigration. What do you think proved decisive? Leonard: The issue that proved to be decisive was immigration, and the fact that sovereignty was given a form that was much less abstract —  with this idea that when you’re in the European Union with freedom of movement, you can’t decide who gets to live in your country anymore. One of the problems with immigration is though there’s an aggregate benefit [from immigration] to the economy and a huge amount of evidence of that —  people who come pay much more in taxes than they receive in benefits —  [the benefit is] not shared equally. There are losers as well as winners. If you have very large numbers of people coming into neighborhoods without tracking who’s going where, and without moving resources to local authorities to make sure they have enough money to create schools and hospitals, that does put pressure on public services. It puts pressure on house prices, and it can put pressure on wages in certain sectors. That’s what’s happened. It’s the   voters who have risen up against the elites. They don’t trust anyone who they blame for having created these circumstances. In a way, there are very strong parallels with the rise of Trump in the U. S. Friedman: If you had to identify the key proximate cause of the vote, was it the 2008 financial crisis? Was it the current wave of migration to Europe? Was it the European debt crisis? Leonard: I think it was a combination of different things. But I think, first of all, it was the enlargement of the European Union and the fact that other countries had not opened their borders up, which meant that there were very large numbers of people who came into the U. K. The U. K. was not prepared for it. Secondly, that was made worse with the [2008] financial crisis. You had austerity [policies] being brought in, public services being cut, and people were blaming immigration rather than the austerity measures taken by the government.\n",

      ", I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. First, are the results really binding? For the  “remain” side, this may be more wishful thinking than anything —  given the scale of the “leave” victory —  but, in theory at least, the referendum’s results are not binding. That’s because, in the U. K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. Referenda themselves are rare in the country —  and Thursday’s was only the third in U. K. history. Here’s more from the Financial Times earlier this month: The relevant legislation did not provide for the referendum result to have any formal trigger effect. The referendum is advisory rather than mandatory. The 2011 referendum on electoral reform did have an obligation on the government to legislate in the event of a “yes” vote (the vote was “no” so this did not matter). But no such provision was included in the EU referendum legislation. What happens next in the event of a vote to leave is therefore a matter of politics not law. It will come down to what is politically expedient and practicable. The UK government could seek to ignore such a vote to explain it away and characterise it in terms that it has no credibility or binding effect (low turnout may be such an excuse). Or they could say it is now a matter for parliament, and then endeavour to win the parliamentary vote. Or ministers could try to   another deal and put that to another referendum. There is, after all, a tradition of EU member states repeating referendums on   matters until voters eventually vote the “right” way. The Guardian has a similar explainer. The official mechanism for the U. K. to leave the EU is the invocation of Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Here’s what that says: 1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. 2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218( 3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. 3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period. 4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it. A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238( 3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 5. If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49. Article 50 has not yet been invoked, but it’s highly unlikely that, now that the referendum results have been announced, the will of the British public will be ignored just because the political establishment doesn’t like the outcome. The EU itself appears to be ready for the U. K. to leave. Here’s the joint EU statement: We now expect the United Kingdom government to give effect to this decision of the British people as soon as possible, however painful that process may be. Any delay would unnecessarily prolong uncertainty. We have rules to deal with this in an orderly way. Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the procedure to be followed if a Member State decides to leave the European Union. We stand ready to launch negotiations swiftly with the United Kingdom regarding the terms and conditions of its withdrawal from the European Union. How long will it take for the U. K. to actually leave? No country has voted to leave the EU before, so there’s no precedent to judge by. But in theory, it’s supposed to take two years. In this time the U. K. will negotiate with the EU’s other 27 members on how to extricate itself from the bloc. The U. K. remains an EU member, with all the rights and privileges associated with that, until then. The   term is the period spelled out in an EU briefing paper on Article 50. Here’s what the paper says: The right of a Member State to withdraw from the European Union was introduced for the first time with the Lisbon Treaty the possibility of withdrawal was highly controversial before that. Article 50 TEU does not set down any substantive conditions for a Member State to be able to exercise its right to withdraw, rather it includes only procedural requirements. It provides for the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement between the EU and the withdrawing state, defining in particular the latter’s future relationship with the Union. If no agreement is concluded within two years, that state’s membership ends automatically, unless the European Council and the Member State concerned decide jointly to extend this period. The legal consequence of a withdrawal from the EU is the end of the application of the EU Treaties (and the Protocols thereto) in the state concerned from that point on. EU law ceases to apply in the withdrawing state, although any national acts adopted in implementation or transposition of EU law would remain valid until the national authorities decide to amend or repeal them. A withdrawal agreement would need to address the   of EU financial programmes and other EU norms. Experts agree that in order to replace EU law, specifically in any field of exclusive EU competence, the withdrawing state would need to enact substantial new legislation and that, in any case, complete isolation of the withdrawing state from the effects of the EU acquis would be impossible if there is to be a future relationship between former Member State and the EU. Furthermore, a withdrawal agreement could contain provisions on the transitional application of EU rules, in particular with regard to rights deriving from EU citizenship and to other rights deriving from EU law, which would otherwise extinguish with the withdrawal. What happens to the U. K.? The United Kingdom comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Among them, the “leave” side won in England and Wales, while most voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. Leaders in both places have said they will explore options to continue their relationship with the EU. In Scotland, the “remain” camp won by a 62     margin. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, says those numbers mean Scotland wants to continue its relationship with the EU, and, she says, a referendum on Scottish independence from the U. K. “must be on the table, and it is on the table. ” This would be a second Scottish referendum on independence. The previous one, held in 2014, was close. It had an 84 percent turnout, and the side that campaigned for continued union with the U. K. won with 55. 3 percent of the vote those who wanted independence won 44. 7 percent.  Turnout in Scotland for Thursday’s referendum was 68. 4 percent —  far lower than the figure for the rest of the U. K. Northern Ireland also voted for the U. K. to remain, by a 56    percent margin. First Minister Arlene Foster of the Democratic Unionist Party, the predominantly Protestant grouping, said the results showed “we are now entering a new era of an even stronger United Kingdom. ” But Martin McGuinness, the deputy first minister, who belongs to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, says the results show Northern Ireland should be able to vote on a union with the Republic of Ireland, which is an EU member.    Dragging us out of Europe will be to the detriment of all our citizens and will be bad for business, trade, investment, and wider society. I, and all Sinn Fein ministers will work to ensure the political institutions remain on a stable footing, but it is very difficult to put detailed contingencies in place until we know the extent of the impact of Brexit on our finances, our infrastructure and health services. All of that is still subject to a negotiation but the fact is that we are in unchartered waters. Sinn Fein will be seeking an urgent meeting with the Irish government, the European institutions and also with our counterparts in Scotland to discuss how we move forward in the best interests of all of our people. It’s unclear what this means. The U. K. government has ruled out any such vote in Northern Ireland, but the contradictory comments put at risk the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended the Troubles, a   period of fighting between nationalists and unionists in which some 3, 500 people died, and brought political stability to the region. What about Gibraltar?  Nearly 96 percent of the 30, 000 people in the British overseas territory voted to remain in the EU. Gibraltar, which is near Spain, has been Britain’s since 1713, but Spain claims it as its own. On Friday, Spanish officials raised the possibility of joint sovereignty with the U. K. over Gibraltar. Here’s Jose Manuel   Spain’s acting foreign minister: It’s a complete change of outlook that opens up new possibilities on Gibraltar not seen for a very long time. I hope the formula of   —  to be clear, the Spanish flag on the Rock —  is much closer than before. Britain’s unlikely to cede any control over Gibraltar, however. What happens to the expats?   This is a complicated question that has consequences for millions of people across the EU. About 1. 3 million Britons live in EU countries (Spain, Ireland, and France are their top destinations). About 3 million EU citizens live in the U. K. (Poles, Irish, and Germans are the top three groups). Nothing changes for any of them until the U. K. officially leaves the EU. But as the U. K. negotiates the terms of its exit, the fate of these approximately 4. 3 million people is likely to be a top concern. The two sides could continue to allow the free right to work —  but that’s unlikely given how European immigration to the U. K. was seen as a driver for the vote to leave. What we are likely to see are restrictions on the movement of workers that range from limited to extreme. Some EU citizens might have to apply for work permits to live and work in the U. K. which at present has a   system for workers from outside the EU. U. K. expatriates in Europe may have to apply for a Blue Card work permit in EU countries, which have restrictive rules for   citizens looking to live and work within their borders. There are also tax and inheritance consequences for expatriates who own property in the U. K. and the EU. Are there economic consequences? If the global markets Friday are to be believed, then the answer is yes. But one day’s data does not an economic trend make, so we’ll point you to the boatloads of mainstream economists and international financial institutions that predicted dire economic consequences in the event of a “leave” vote. Fed Chair Janet Yellen warned of “significant economic repercussions. ” Roberto Azevedo, the head of the World Trade Organization, said leaving the EU would cost Britons an extra $13. 2 billion in import tariffs. The nonpartisan Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that Britain could face two more years of austerity measures if it votes to leave the EU. The OECD said Brexit would constitute a tax of £2200 per household per year (about $3, 000) by 2020 and up to £5000 ($6, 817) by 2030. International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde said the impact of Brexit on the U. K.’s economy could range from “pretty bad to very, very bad. ” And, finally, Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, warned the consequences “could possibly include a technical recession. ” What about the impact on rules and regulations? The FT says untangling U. K. rules from the EU’s “would take years and could create constitutional mayhem. ” The “leave” vote has consequences not only for British citizens, companies, and public authorities, but also London’s relationship with Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Laws in those places say acts of their legislative bodies that don’t comply with EU rules are not law. The problem, as the FT points out: The nature of the British legal system poses particular challenges for those wanting to roll back existing EU legislation: much of it has been incorporated into British law and tested in the courts, and has thus become part of case law. This means that, even if a statute is removed, its principles  —   for example, on legislation governing workers’ rights  —   would remain in force. To put the scale of what’s happening in context, here’s Daniel Shurman, a partner at Allen  Overy, who told the FT Brexit was a case “of the world’s   economy leaving the world’s largest trade bloc. ” “If one wanted to rewrite the many thousands of pages [of relevant legislation] from the start it would obviously be an incredibly complex and   task,” he told the newspaper, “and I don’t think people have fully fathomed the challenge. ” What’s next for the EU? This too is a complicated question. There were fears that Britain’s exit would energize Euroskeptics across the bloc. Indeed, polls in Denmark have suggested that the country would vote to leave if a referendum were held on membership (none is planned).   parties across Europe rejoiced at the news from Britain Friday. Marine Le Pen, the head of the National Front in France, said on Twitter: “Victory for Freedom! As I have been asking for years, we must now have the same referendum in France and EU countries. ” Similar sentiments were expressed by others across the bloc. Whether that translates to referenda in those countries and subsequent votes to leave is an unknown, however.\n",

      "   I want to receive updates from partners and sponsors. Great Britain’s decision to extricate itself from the EU has consequences that are at once   and unknown. By Friday morning, no market was immune. Great Britain’s currency, the pound, had fallen to its lowest levels since 1985, and the FTSE and DAX plummeted. In the U. S. markets opened in the red, gold (a commodity that many investors flee to at times of uncertainty) was up, and traders around the globe prepared for a volatile day amid the question of what the future will look like with the U. K. untethered from the European Union. The health of an economy is significantly influenced by the policies and regulations that govern its financial systems. But the problem here goes far beyond a change in regulations: The bottom line is that no one really knows what will happen in either Great Britain or the EU —  and that is in and of itself an economic problem. Markets don’t respond well to uncertainty. It’s understandable, then, that Great Britain’s historic move to shed its formal integration with Europe after almost six decades and the resignation of its prime minister in one fell swoop would send markets into a bit of a frenzy. While the country won’t have to face the daunting task of creating a new currency (a point of serious concern during Grexit and the Scottish referendum) many of its political and economic policies remain intertwined with the larger European body. Great Britain will be the first country to actually leave the European Union, and the first to have to make sense of the relatively brief guidance on how to do so provided by Article 50. The severing of this tie means that important tenets of governing, like major laws, regulations and trade arrangements will need to be updated or renegotiated independently, both within the EU and with trade partners outside. Then there’s the fact that Great Britain will need a new leader to oversee these new changes, since Prime Minister David Cameron —  who called for the vote in the first place —  stepped down after its conclusion. That, too could make the road to stability a long, arduous one. Part of the explanation for the markets’ reaction Friday morning is the fact that many didn’t anticipate that the vote would actually swing in the direction of those advocating leaving the EU. And market’s also don’t like surprises. All of that said, the markets have so far not been nearly as volatile as they were during periods of actual economic crisis, such as the financial meltdown of 2008. That’s somewhat comforting to those who feared that a rift between Britain and the EU would plunge the global economy into a tailspin. But still, the reaction has been significant. As of Friday morning, $171 billion was lost in the decline of the FTSE. And as Justin Wolfers noted, American markets moved more on the news of Brexit than they have on news of U. S. presidential elections over the past 60 years. (Of course there are those who may outright benefit from the melee, betting against safety and stability by doing things like shorting British currency or U. K.  banks.) There’s reason to fear that the spiral and volatility, at least for the U. K. will not end anytime soon. With stock markets and currency already taking a beating, some are worried that property markets will be next. Additionally some major economic players and investors, such as global investment banks, may shift their global strategies by moving jobs out of the U. K. after publicly supporting the campaign to stay attached to the E. U. No one can forecast how the separation will play out, politically or economically —  and that alone is something to worry about. Bourree Lam contributed reporting to this article.\n",

      "    Timing is everything.  What sounded like an   trip to a foreign business enterprise turned into a perfect foreign policy photo op for Donald Trump.  He stood on the shimmering southwest Scottish coast, launched his refurbed Turnberry golf course, and praised the just announced results of the UK referendum on the the European Union.   ”People want to take their country back,” Trump declared, ”They want to have independence.” It was a bit more complicated than that.  But the question was that simple, yes or no, stay in the EU or leave.  The Brits chose leave.  And everyone was shocked.    The anchors and analysts on British TV began to see it coming a bit after midnight.  Others woke up the next morning and were (in their words) ” .” All day the country reeled.  The stock market sank. The Pound weakened.  And Prime Minister Cameron took one for the team, announcing his resignation. Up here in Scotland, the majority of folks voted to stay in the European Union.  Their leader Nicola Sturgeon announced they’d have another independence vote.  And this time Scotland might break free. At one point, as we trailed the Trump caravan, cameraman Mal James turned to me and said, this is the biggest European story since the fall of the Berlin Wall.  And he was right.  I was there to see the Fall of the Wall.  It  meant the end of the Soviet Union and the east bloc.      Two years after the Wall fell I moved to Europe.   I’ve lived in and covered it  for 25 years, first in Germany, then Paris, now London.   And through all those years the momentum was always towards a closer and bigger Union. The Maastricht Treaty, the Euro Common  Currency, new and more member states (starting at six it is now numbers 28).  Then the troubles starting building as well.  Economic crises, immigration chaos,   terror.    Now some think the UK vote could mean the end of the EU.  Other countries look at what happened here and are starting to think about doing the same thing.  Calls for new exit votes are coming from France and the Netherlands.  And the Eurocrats in Brussels and   leaders like German Chancellor Merkel are hurriedly saying they will ” ” the body.  As Washington watches with concern.   With the UK as the key   for the US and the EU, President Obama personally called for Brits to stay in.    They didn’t listen to him either.   As I waited on line at the highway   cash register, on our way from Turnberry to the next Trump Scotland stop, the whole day’s events was summed up.  ”Don’t get me started,”the   cashier told me when I asked her about the result, clearly upset.  The majority of young people voted to stayed in. They wanted to stay connected in an increasingly   world, Then I turned around in line and noticed an   man standing behind me with a   in his hand he was set to buy.    ”What are you going to do with that?” I asked.  ”I want to keep the pidgeons out of my garden,” he replied.  ”They’re a real problem.” The majority of older people voting wanted to leave the European Union. They were worried about borders they say are out of control.  And laws imposed not of their making.  What will happen next?   No one on the radio we were listening to could come up with an answer.   Will Britain become ”Great” again?   Or just shrink into ”Little England.”  Time to contemplate that one shortly in Aberdeen, with a glass of Scotland’s finest.   Neat.   No ice.

      " Editor’s note: The following column originally appeared on Heatstreet. com.  So in the end patriotism won through. In 1975 the mood of national defeatism was so strong that the British people succumbed to membership of the European Economic Community (as it was then called). This decision has at last been reversed. The extraordinary defiance of this simple determination that we should govern ourselves has left me more proud of my country than ever before. Heineken once advertised the claim that it “refreshes the parts other beers cannot reach”. The referendum reached parts of the electorate that politics normally doesn’t reach. The turnout was 72 per cent  —   well up on the General Election last year when 66 per cent voted. But there was more to it than those stats imply. Within the total were hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people who voted for the first time for many years. Often they live on council estates, they felt alienated by “the system”. Those are the ones who tuned out long ago but yesterday they suddenly grasped that here was something worth participating in. These are the people that the pundits and pollsters had missed. Watching the faces of the BBC presenters during the results coverage was quite a sight to behold. Nor was this just about the United Kingdom. When I was campaigning locally I was struck by the number of times foreign radio and TV crews wanted to tag along. It became apparent that our little island was attracting wider interest during our deliberations. There is now every prospect that Britain’s example will be followed. The whole stinking monolith of the EU could come crashing down giving way to a prosperous and free Europe of nation states. Even before the British referendum there was an opinion poll showing most Dutch people would like to leave the EU. To continue reading Harry Phibbs’ oped on Heatstreet. com, click here.   \n",

      "Athens, Greece  —   It was clear by early Friday that the British electorate has given two fingers to the European Union, and voted for “Brexit. ” It is less clear how Britain will extricate itself from its treaty obligations to the EU, whether the EU’s leaders will carry out their threat to punish the British for their patriotic disobedience, and what the economic gains and losses will be. We can, however, see the political winners and losers after a referendum that will surely mark a watershed not just in British history, but in the history of that sorry collision of ideals and reality, the European Union. The first casualty is Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron campaigned for reelection in 2015 by promising to hold a referendum on the question of Britain’s EU membership. The election strengthened his position in the Westminster Parliament  —   he shed the Conservative party’s Liberal Democrat coalition partners  —   but left him hostage to his election promise. Favoring the “Remain” camp, Cameron dismissed the “Leave” campaign as economic illiterates and provincial fanatics “Little Englanders,” an insult from the days of Gladstone, was bandied about. But he had misread the mood of the country, and of his own party and cabinet. Attacked from without and within, Cameron was hoist by his own petard. His Remain campaign never took the initiative, but devolved into a series of rearguard actions. By the spring, Remain was in such trouble that Cameron was looking to the Labour party for help. RELATED: The Brexit Vote Was Just the Beginning, This morning, as the FTSE Index shed £100 billion, Cameron did the right thing. He announced his resignation, and promised to respect the will of the people, or at least the 51. 9 percent who voted to leave. Corbyn, whose entire career has been a series of wrong things, will surely succumb soon   probably ambushed in the Senate by the vengeful allies of Tonius Blairus. Share article on FacebookshareTweet The big winners, domestically at least, are Nigel Farage and the U. K. Independence Party (UKIP). But for how long? UKIP draws the support of both traditional,   Conservatives and the remains of the old Labour   vote. Farage, one of the few significant British politicians to have worked outside politics, is not so much a dog whistler, as a gatherer of canines by use of a megaphone. The refrain in his bellowed melody is always a chorus about immigration. This morning, he called for June 23 to enter the calendar as “our Independence Day. ” Unsurprisingly, UKIP has attracted the support of neofascists. But they are less numerous in Britain than in the EU countries. Will Farage’s larger number of recruits from the Conservatives and Labour remain loyal, now that Brexit is also the policy of the larger parties? Over the English Channel, in that barren speck of land known to the islanders as “The Continent,” the biggest loser is the EU itself. The drive to “  Union” ran into the sand in 2005, when the French public rejected the idea. The Brexit vote repudiates the purported ideals of the Union, and excoriates the actual failings of the Brussels government. We may see in Britain what we saw in Ireland, the Brechtian spectacle of the public being told to vote again and to get it right this time. But a “United States of Europe” has never looked so improbable. So we can add Vladimir Putin to the list of winners, and Turkey to the losers. The EU has no army, but Britain is its strongest military power. An EU without Britain, its economy stagnant, its defenses down, and its American friend uninterested, will be music to Putin’s ears. Expect more adventurism in Eastern Europe  —   especially with the U. S. election looming. RELATED: The World Turned Upside Down, Turkey is always the bridesmaid when it comes to the EU. Usually, it is the French who jilt Turkey. This time, it was Britain, which has consistently supported Turkish entry into the EU, albeit in the hope of loosening the bonds of Brussels. Those bonds are now to face what may be their final stress test. The news about Brexit reached me in Athens, whose early inhabitants would meet on the Hill of the Pnyx to engage in direct democracy, mass voting on key issues. “Brexit?” more than one local asked me in the days before the vote. “And then Grexit?” More Brexit The SNP Won’t Let the Issue of Scottish Independence GoAfter the U. K.

In Greece as in Italy and Spain, the temptation to escape decades of debt to Germany by floating a weak drachma, or lira, or peseta may prove irresistible. If you are taking a European holiday this summer, expect lots of hot weather and plenty of economic turbulence. And take plenty of U. S. dollars, too. Talking of which, one of the many low shots in a vulgar referendum campaign was Cameron’s use of President Obama for the Remain camp. The president delivered a press conference like an emperor upbraiding the impertinent subjects of some ramshackle border province. At the time, and right up to the eve of the vote, the polls swung back and forth, and the commentators hedged. We should have known: If Obama was for Remain, then Leave always was the strong horse.,\n",

      "The 52 —  48 win for Brexit in yesterday’s referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union was more momentous than any election result in the U. K.’s history. It was swiftly followed this morning by David Cameron’s announcement that he would resign in the autumn, the right decision and the honorable course for the prime minister to take. More than anyone else, Mr. Cameron was the unwitting author of Britain’s exit. It was more than his simply misjudging the mood of the British people, although that played a part, reflected in the highest national turnout since the 1992 election. His mistake was to misunderstand the provisional nature of the British people’s commitment to the European Union. For them, it should have been an economic arrangement. To settle the European question for a generation, as he had intended, Cameron had to reconcile this with the EU’s federalist mission. Could he square the circle? When in February 2013, he first announced his decision to hold the referendum, Mr. Cameron declared that making it a vote between the status quo and leaving would create an “entirely false choice. ” What was needed was “fundamental,   change. ” The real choice, he argued, should be to decide whether to be part of a new settlement or to leave the European Union altogether. He never gave Britain that choice. They were the words of a PR man, not a statesman. Instead he rushed the negotiations with the EU and boxed himself in with an unnecessary deadline to get the referendum out of the way early in his second term. Neither he nor his fellow European leaders took the risk of Brexit seriously. The negotiation was, as I wrote here in February, a case of Mr. Cameron asking for little and getting less. RELATED: The Brexit Vote Was Just the Beginning, Without a credible answer and with nothing to show for Mr. Cameron’s renegotiation, the Remain camp resorted to Project Fear. The    contrasts damaged his credibility: Before Project Fear, the British economy would do all right outside the EU after, it would be putting a bomb under the economy. People have longer memories than he thought. Share article on FacebookshareTweet “Brits don’t quit,” Cameron said in his    appeal from Downing Street. “We get involved. We take a lead. ” The last Conservative prime minister, John Major, had wanted to put Britain at the heart of Europe. Major’s attempt, by keeping open the prospect of Britain joining the single currency, divided the Conservative party and contributed to its historic defeat in the 1997 election. But the battle wasn’t definitively lost until Tony Blair realized he couldn’t take Britain into the euro. Events vindicated the economics of that decision. Politically, it meant Britain could never be at the heart of Europe, something that was acknowledged by Britain’s special   status in David Cameron’s renegotiation, without  —   fatally  —   putting in place the architecture to have made it work. Cameron and the Remain campaign made a final mistake. At one point, Cameron’s pollster tweeted that virtually every intelligent person thought leaving the EU a stupid idea. After the horrible murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox, “Stronger In” became “Kinder In. ” The implication was that people concerned about immigration or just not happy being governed from Brussels were   xenophobic, or worse.  When you try to delegitimize somebody’s vote, you don’t change his mind, only his willingness to talk about it. The effect was to understate Leave in the polls. Of the nine final polls, seven showed Remain in the lead, with Remain’s pollster showing a   lead. The same effect was present in exit polls commissioned by hedge funds, which led to Brexit campaigners prematurely conceding the result of the referendum and to markets confidently pricing in a Remain win. There was a spiral of silence at work which deceived the Remain camp about where it stood and the campaign it should have fought. More Brexit The SNP Won’t Let the Issue of Scottish Independence GoAfter the U. K. Election, Expect Brexit to Continue ApaceBrexit Is an Embrace of the Global Economy’s New GeographyAt a news conference ten days before the Brexit vote, European Council president Donald Tusk spoke of his fear of a Leave vote as “the beginning of the destruction of not only the EU but also of western political civilization in its entirety. ” Although mocked, Tusk was on to something. There is a crisis. It is a crisis of Western leadership and a ruling elite that spends too much time talking to each other at Davos and Bilderberg gatherings and not enough to the people they lead. In reclaiming the right to govern themselves, Britons have done something of supreme value for Europe and the West. They have told political leaders to get back to attending to the people’s business. Democracy means government by the people. That is what Britain’s vote for Brexit reaffirms.,\n",

      "London  —   Sometimes a   supporter of a certain point of view can best see what the weaknesses of that position is. After a   panel of   experts had delivered an autopsy of Britain’s membership in the European Union for the Mile End Institute Friday morning, I sought out the one member of the panel who had expressed concern about the EU’s “democratic deficit. ” I got an earful about how an EU that refused to reform and acknowledge its limits invited Britain’s vote to leave this week. Brigitte Granville is a French monetary economist who worked at the old European Economic Community in the 1980s before it morphed into the EU. She played a key role in restructuring the ruble while working for the Russian Ministry of Finance in the early 1990s. She moved to Britain because she found it a freer and less rigid country than her native land: “There are 5, 000 people in charge of everything in France. They are all linked by school and marriage, and they are tight. ” RELATED: The Brexit Vote Was Just the Beginning, Just ten days ago, Granville attended a major EU conference in Sopot, Poland, where Klaus Regling, the managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, was speaking. “He said things I couldn’t accept about how well the Euro was doing, so I spoke up,” she recalls. “He dismissed me by saying I didn’t know anything about economic history. Afterwards, several bureaucrats sought me out to chastise me for giving him a hard time. The audience was 1, 000 people accepting what they were told. ” The predicament of Europe’s political establishment stems from a combination of irrational fear and vain ambition. This is particularly apparent in France, where the monetary union has often been viewed as a tool for harnessing Germany’s economic strength to project power worldwide. . . . France’s global ambition is apparent whenever its mainstream politicians discuss the euro. For example, in 2011, Edmond Alphandéry, a former economy minister, declared that a eurozone exit by a member country was as likely as a dollar exit by Texas or California. Here, on full display, was the wishful thinking that brought the euro into existence in the first place: its French architects dreamed of a Europe that could equal the US. That was always an illusory ambition, but it continues to cloud European leaders’ judgment. After eight years of austerity, monetary shocks, and a reshuffling of accounts that would astound a    con artist in Times Square, where is Europe? Greece is bankrupt, with a towering debt. Portugal has a debt load larger than even Japan’s. France seems stuck in a permanent recession. Italy and Spain have still not reached the output levels that they had before the 2008 financial crisis. It’s only because of quantitative easing and negative interest rates that the eurozone hasn’t collapsed like a house of cards. Small wonder, then, that a new survey by the Pew Research Center found that 61 percent of French voters have an unfavorable view of the EU. A clear majority want powers returned to the French parliament. The equivalent unfavorable figure for the EU by British voters was 48 percent in the Pew survey. On Thursday, 52 percent of voters voted to leave the EU, the most dramatic of demonstrations of an “unfavorable” attitude. More Brexit The SNP Won’t Let the Issue of Scottish Independence GoAfter the U. K. Election, Expect Brexit to Continue ApaceBrexit Is an Embrace of the Global Economy’s New GeographyDutch politician Geert Wilders is already calling for a referendum for the Netherlands to leave the EU. In Italy, a clear majority tell pollsters they would vote to leave. But the response of EU leaders is to ignore the rising tide of criticism and call for more European integration. “There is a real case for a strong monetary union with transparency and real enforcement of the rules of fiscal discipline,” Professor Granville told me. “But that’s not what is happening. They muddle through and make things worse. ” Although she voted for Remain, Granville does see the British vote as “huge, a real shock” threatening to burst the bubble of unreality that EU officials live in. The only way they can rescue their beloved European project of “ever closer union” would be to finally leave that bubble and explore the impact of their policies and   rule on ordinary people. No one is holding their breath expecting this to happen. It seems inevitable that the firestorm touched off by British voters will jump the English Channel and inflame the continent.,\n",

      "‘The World Turned Upside Down” was the tune that British troops played as they marched out of their fortifications at Yorktown, following Cornwallis’s surrender to George Washington in 1781. It expressed the shock and disbelief British elites felt as, against all the odds, Americans had won their independence and had become a sovereign nation. Now we see the same elite shock and disbelief that Britons, against all the polls, have voted to leave the EU. I was one of the few commentators who thought it possible, even likely, they would (see my last NRO article, “Britain’s Declaration of Independence. ”) It’s time to reflect on what the future holds. RELATED: The Brexit Vote Was Just the Beginning, Markets will go down, then recover. This was the No. 1 threat that Remainers held over the heads of those wanting to leave: that the pound and global markets would plunge. The majority of British voters rejected that financial blackmail, and while the markets will go down temporarily, expect reason to return and the global financial order to adjust  —   maybe sooner than the doomsayers predict. This is the doom of the European Union. Some speculate that Scotland, which voted two to one to Remain, might try to vote its own independence in order to rejoin the EU. Problem is, there may not be an EU to rejoin. Britain’s departure will take two years of negotiation in that time, other countries will very likely follow Britain’s lead and arrange their own exit from a European Union that no one loves and no one respects. This is a big win for Donald Trump, and a big defeat for Barack Obama. Trump was the only major public figure outside Britain to come out in favor of Leave. When Obama was threatening that a   Britain would be moved to the “back of the queue” as far as trade deals were concerned, Trump said that Britain would be moved to the front of the queue if he became president. Britons had the sense to reject Obama’s advice and to realize that whatever Obama thinks is a bad idea is probably a brilliant one. Whatever they think of Trump, he looks their best friend. More Brexit The SNP Won’t Let the Issue of Scottish Independence GoAfter the U. K.

For decades they’ve been pushing the idea that national sovereignty is an obstacle to progress and that the   is a relic of the past. It’s a matter of bitter regret to them that, under a democracy and representative government, ordinary people have any say at all in their fate and future. You could hear the bitterness in Tony Blair’s voice this morning on Fox News as he spoke of the referendum (he was a big proponent of staying). So expect plenty of angry outcry claims that the vote is racist, xenophobic, isolationist, etc. especially from young people who’ve been taught that any patriotic or nationalist feeling carries a whiff of Nazism. The truth is very different. Winston Churchill famously said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others. The British people have reasserted their right to govern themselves as they, not others, see fit. This is the very essence of independence: independence for a nation, independence for the individual. It is the hallmark of modernity: the belief that independence of judgment, thought, and action is morally superior to dependence on others. It’s also the belief that modern liberalism most aggressively seeks to undermine. Liberalism took a major hit with Britain’s declaration of independence yesterday, a shot “heard round the world. ” It may just be the first.,\n",

      "When the first results came in from Sunderland last night, you could tell something was going wrong. Sunderland, an industrial city on the North Sea, had voted 61 percent for Leave, a far larger margin than had been expected. It was an ominous sign for the Remain camp, and a hopeful one for Leave, which had begun the night expecting defeat. But with a victory deep in the Labour heartland, the signs looked a little bit rosier for Leave. Those results mark an uncomfortable truth for observers of the Brexit debate on both sides of the Atlantic. What pushed Leave over the edge was not   Tory England many of those areas did indeed cast their ballots for Leave, but not by    margins. For Leave, the real victories came in the north, deep in the Labour heartland, where   disaffection with immigration, elites, and the European Union proved a potent force in pushing traditionally   voters to side with Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, and Nigel Farage in their quest to leave the European Union. RELATED: The Brexit Vote Was Just the Beginning, Take Hartlepool, for instance. Hartlepool is a port city in County Durham, one of the places where high unemployment has been the norm since the 1990s. It’s solidly  : For decades, it has elected a Labour MP to Parliament. But on Thursday night, Hartlepool went 70 percent for Brexit. RELATED: The World Turned Upside Down, The story reads the same throughout the north. In Doncaster  —   a city represented by three Labour MPs, one of them Ed Miliband, the party’s former leader  —   69 percent of the vote went for Leave. Burnley has had either a Labour or a Liberal MP since the First World War, but   of its voters favored leaving the EU. Wigan is a safe Labour seat, and has been since 1918, but it, too, voted heavily for Leave. That so much of the Labour heartland, of the constituencies over which Labour has enjoyed a stranglehold for a century or more, should vote for Leave is surprising, but not a wholly unpredictable. It is the direct result of the lackluster backing that the leadership of the Labour party, especially Jeremy Corbyn, offered for the Remain campaign. If this referendum has exposed any stark new reality about British politics, it is the sheer level of disconnect between the governing elites and the people they represent nowhere is that reality more visible than in the Labour party. Share article on FacebookshareTweet The Labour party officially supported the Remain campaign. Corbyn had his reservations, to be sure  —   the man views the EU as something of a capitalist conspiracy to stifle the welfare state  —   but he campaigned for Remain. Yet a poll in late May found that only just over half of Labour voters could correctly say their party’s position on the issue. Either Labour MPs weren’t making the case for Remain to their constituents or their constituents weren’t listening. In any case, Labour failed to corral its voters into opposing Johnson and Gove and into embracing the cosmopolitan stance the party seeks to espouse. Part of this comes from the fact that the cosmopolitan stance that now characterizes the Labour party is not quite the traditional   stance  —   and, from a certain perspective, is actually antithetical to   beliefs. One of the foremost proponents of an   position was the late Tony Benn, known to all as a staunch socialist and defender of the Left. He was an ardent Eurosceptic, opposed to his country’s membership of the EU on grounds that he framed in terms of sovereignty and democracy. Jeremy Corbyn descends from the Bennite tradition, and many suspect that his views align far more closely with Benn’s than he would care to admit: hence, perhaps, his apparent lack of enthusiasm for the EU, and his insistence on making the campaign against Brexit a campaign against Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage rather than a campaign for the EU. Indeed, Tariq Ali, a prominent   writer and confidant of Corbyn, recently said the Labour leader would have supported Brexit had he still been a backbencher. In northern England, Labour voters have retained that Bennite outlook, though their party has moved past it. The stunning gap between leaders and the people has never been more evident. Typical of election   the losing side has begun to point the fingers of blame inward. Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, explicitly faulted Corbyn and his “bizarre refusal to share a platform in the face of the greatest challenge our country has faced in a generation” for Leave’s victory. Corbyn already faces a   motion within his own party. The message is clear: In this generation’s ultimate political moment, you failed. Corbyn campaigned on a strictly   theme, but it turned out his party’s voters felt more strongly about the EU than they did about the Tories. RELATED: Cameron’s Fatal Mistake, And Corbyn’s failure has put his party in mortal danger. Much   commentary has focused on the Tory party, and, to be certain, that party now faces a critical juncture, with its prime minister set to step down and its future dreadfully murky. But Labour may face a similar moment, and one perhaps more threatening to its   viability as a party. The roots of this brewing crisis began under the leadership of Tony Blair, when Labour shifted away from its   base to become a party of liberal cosmopolitanism, of London rather than the   north. Signs of unease were evident at the 2015 general election, when UKIP bested the Tories to come in second in many Labour constituencies across the traditional   strongholds of northern England. Now the process is nearly complete. By voting en masse for Brexit, Labour voters turned away from their party’s official position and lodged an incisive protest against what the modern party stands for. In places like Sunderland, Doncaster, and Wigan, they rejected cultural cosmopolitanism outright. More Brexit The SNP Won’t Let the Issue of Scottish Independence GoAfter the U. K. Election, Expect Brexit to Continue ApaceBrexit Is an Embrace of the Global Economy’s New GeographyLabour is now wounded, in a position of vulnerable weakness. Any political momentum the party might have gained with a Remain victory now lies firmly with UKIP, assuming the party can capitalize on Leave’s victory (which is, admittedly, not certain to occur). The referendum revealed the hollowness of Labour’s support in the north  —   yes, it’s the Labour heartland, comprising the bulk of the party’s seats, but it is a place with which the party’s leadership is desperately out of touch. If a general election is held in the coming months, Labour must grapple with the very real possibility of losing dozens of seats to UKIP or Johnson’s wing of the Tory party. The Left’s weakness in modern Britain is nothing new, but Leave’s victory has exposed just how deep the crisis runs. Against the wishes of their party, Labour voters have delivered victory for the Leave campaign. Corbyn’s Labour faces an existential moment. The choices the party makes in the next few weeks will define its prospects for a generation. And this introspection must address, first and foremost, the unalterable fact that the most solid of Labour constituencies turned against the party and pushed Britain out of the European Union.  —   Noah   is an intern at National Review. \n",

      "The British people have voted  —   and that means important implications for travelers headed across the pond. The immediate effect? American visitors will pay less for travel to and within Europe and Britain. If the British pound continues to stay low or fall even more, your trip to England will be cheaper. In the shadow of   the pound recently traded at levels (circa $1. 33) not seen since 1985, making hotels, meals, shopping and other purchases at least 10 percent cheaper. Needless to say, it’s a good time to buy pounds for an upcoming trip. The same thing applies to the euro: It, too, fell as a result of Brexit, almost reaching parity with the greenback, and will likely stay low versus the dollar. So Europe, too, will be cheaper than ever for US travelers.

The pound recently traded at levels (circa $1. 33) not seen since 1985, making hotels, meals, shopping and other purchases at least 10 percent cheaper. On the other hand, with their currencies weaker, fewer British and Europeans will visit the US  —   logical, because it’ll cost them more. That will result (happily, for some) in lower airfares for US visitors. Europeans generally pay less to fly to the US than we pay to fly to Europe. (Sounds unfair, right? But it’s the old “what the market will bear” economic argument  —   the same reason that medications cost more in the US than anywhere else.) One reason that airfares from the US to Europe have gone down so much this year is because they’re not coming over here. Now, lower numbers of Europeans and Brits will visit the US than ever. So expect airfares from the US to Europe and Britain to dip even lower. Friday  —   the day after the Brexit vote  —   we saw airfares to London on Virgin Atlantic and other airlines for fall travel reduced to $500  . The future looks murkier for travelers. Once border controls are put in place, it will become harder to move among countries. If Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU, becomes a separate country, you’ll need to go through border controls and show a passport between London and Edinburgh. Because Ireland will remain part of Europe, but Northern Ireland won’t, travel between, say, Dublin and Belfast will also require going through passport control. What’s more worrisome, perhaps, is if Brexit becomes contagious and other disaffected European voters push through similar referendums. No one wants to return to the days of long immigration lines when traveling within Europe  —   and carrying 10 different currencies in purses and wallets. But it could happen.\n",

      "LONDON  —   Britons have voted to leave the European Union, their concerns about immigration and what some saw as the   power of the   bloc trumping the attraction of being part of a single market of more than 500 million people and a European project forged from the ashes of World War II. Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the ruling Conservative Party, is expected to make a statement, most likely outside his official residence at 10 Downing Street. Former London Mayor Boris Johnson has not indicated when he will speak about the “leave” campaign success. U. K. Independence Party chief Nigel Farage, who spoke several times late Thursday and early Friday, also plans a further statement Friday morning. Cameron’s defeat in the referendum represents a political earthquake that may   the Conservative Party leadership, which was deeply split by the Brexit issue, and could cost him his job. “He’s almost certainly got to go,” said Tim Bale, a professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London. “There are too many people who will see him as someone who lost his legitimacy and   …     was outplayed by an opponent who wants to take over as a leader. ”  Friday, plummeting more than 10 percent in six hours on concerns that severing ties with the EU will hurt the U. K. economy and undermine London’s position as a global financial center. Authorities including the International Monetary Fund, the U. S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England had warned Britain’s exit would send shivers through a world economy that is only slowly recovering from the global crisis that began in 2008. Now economists will wait to see if their predictions come to pass. EU leaders will see Britain quitting as a dangerous precedent and a potentially fatal blow to the European project. Some face growing euroskepticism from their own citizens and may feel the need to make a strong case domestically for why the    bloc has a future. This could lead to reforms of how the EU works. Future negotiations may be overshadowed by a sense of betrayal and the feeling that an example needs to be made of the U. K. to discourage others from leaving too. The fallout could also hit Europe’s fragile growth. Germany’s Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble recently said that “it would be a miracle if a withdrawal of Britain would come without economic disadvantages. ” On the other hand, a British exit, or Brexit, could spur the European Union into action. Since joining the club in 1973, Britain has shaped the bloc mainly by putting the brakes on the drive toward   political union, a project that could now be revived with gusto. Britain’s referendum doesn’t automatically trigger an exit from the European Union, which has led a few commentators to suggest that lawmakers might simply decide to ignore or   the process. So could they? “In legal theory that is possible. In practice that is absolutely not possible,” said Alan Renwick, the deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College London. “If there is a vote for Brexit then on Friday the PM will indicate how the process of Brexit will begin. The result will trigger a new series of negotiations as Britain and the EU search for a way to separate economies that have become intertwined since the U. K. joined the bloc on Jan. 1, 1973. Under Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union, talks would likely last two years, with the possibility for extension if all of the remaining 27 EU nations agree. But the clock starts ticking only when the U. K. notifies the EU that it wants a divorce  —   and some on the “leave” side have suggested that this won’t occur until 2018. However, the EU may not accept a delayed exit. “U. K. negotiations with the European Union will prove difficult, given that EU leaders will not want to set a precedent for an easy withdrawal for other countries that could reconsider their status, such as Denmark,” said Howard Archer of IHS, a research firm. No matter what, the EU will face issues. Alongside economic woes, troubles with Greece and the inability to agree on how to manage a refugee emergency, a British exit would deepen Europe’s existential crisis.\n",

      "Donald Trump landed in Scotland on Friday in a typically confused state of mind. Not because he was promoting his private business instead of, you know, running for president. But because  —   God bless him  —   he couldn’t figure out what just happened. It turns out that foreign affairs can be even more complicated than running a golf course. “Just arrived in Scotland. Place is going wild over the vote,” he tweeted. “They took their country back, just like we will take America back. No games!” If he had any aides or policy advisers, beyond his own brain watching cable news, someone might have told him that Scotland voted decisively to stay inside the European Union. And that Scotland will likely now vote to leave the United Kingdom and   the EU on its own. Such things might matter to an international businessman running a company in a foreign country. Or to a wannabe leader of the free world. But Trump told reporters on Friday that he wasn’t traveling with foreign policy aides because “there’s nothing to talk about”. That should calm the markets, if nothing else does. For the last few months, the snooty Brits have rather enjoyed the reality TV show known as the 2016 elections. It has been quite entertaining  —   although at times a little unsettling  —   to wonder if the American voter was truly reckless enough to nominate a strangely coiffed carnival barker with a casual disregard for the facts, running on a xenophobic and incoherent platform. Now the UK has voted to leave the European Union after a campaign led by their own strangely coiffed carnival barker with a similar hostility to the facts and to foreigners. But before Americans begin to chuckle at Boris Johnson and Britain’s   they should try to learn the lessons of what just happened in the old country. Otherwise they will be preparing for a Trump inaugural parade that rolls past a new Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue in seven short months. First, the rise of charismatic,   leaders can only happen when the weak leaders of the   surrender to them. This is what happened to the British Tories as they struggled through two decades of a rising and rebellious   faction. We’ve been watching the Republican party do the same with the emerging Tea Partiers and Trumpers over the same period. In London, Conservative leaders tried to   extremists instead of pushing their   Euro rebels to join the UK Independence Party. David Cameron’s   promise to hold an EU referendum was a colossal miscalculation designed to appease his own extremists. That   tactic led his own country to economic crisis and ended his career. In Washington, congressional Republicans thought the Tea Party’s   and   spirit was fine to ignore as long they helped undermine President Obama. Instead of ejecting them to join a third party, they embraced them, including their conspiracy theories about the president’s birth and religion. Now, after alternately ignoring and ridiculing Trump, they are shocked that the leader of the birther conspiracy is their nominee. The GOP’s   appeasement has imperiled its own future. This weakness was summed up with more graphic eloquence by Sir Nicholas Soames, a senior Conservative MP and the grandson of Winston Churchill, who knew a thing or two about appeasement. “If you have an Alsatian sitting in front of you, and it growls at you and bares its teeth, there are two ways of dealing with it,” he told the ConservativeHome website. “You can pat it on the head, in which case it’ll bite you. Or you can kick it really hard in the balls, in which case it’ll run away. ” Conservative leaders on both sides of the Atlantic have lacked the courage to kick anyone in the balls. Except, perhaps, themselves. The second lesson is about the siren call of nationalism. In an age of fractured media and financial crisis, it is refreshingly simple to attract a hard core of passionate voters with a nationalist message. Nationalism is a unifying force that exploits the resentment of economic and demographic upheaval. It is much easier to blame shadowy foreign powers and immigrants than it is to help older workers adapt to new skills in new industries. But the forces of nationalism, once unleashed, are not easily contained. David Cameron’s response to a Scottish independence vote was to stoke his own nationalism with a policy of “English votes for English laws”. Less than a year later, English nationalism destroyed his hold on power. The   nativism among the conservative base of the Republican party is no less mortal a threat to the GOP. After pandering to the   and   crowd for years, Republican leaders are now rightly fretting they will lose an entire generation of Latino voters. Like Cameron, they only have themselves to blame. The third lesson is a generational one. British voters under 34 were overwhelmingly supportive of staying inside the EU, but they were also the least likely to vote. That poor turnout meant the economic fate of millennials was decided by their parents and grandparents. Like his nationalist friends in England, Trump draws his electoral strength from older, whiter voters. To date, Hillary Clinton has underwhelmed younger voters who were drawn to the radical promises of her socialist rival, Bernie Sanders. Clinton cannot stop Trump without turning out younger voters in ways the Remain campaign failed to do in England and Wales. The fourth lesson is that voters don’t seem to care about the hypocrisy and inconsistency of the   politicians. Never mind that   politicians were railing against the elites and the EU. Never mind that Trump loves outsourcing and immigrant labor in his struggling businesses, while campaigning against, um, outsourcing businesses and immigrant labor. The sense of betrayal by and distrust of the elites is so rampant, it doesn’t matter who says it. “I think people in this country have had enough of experts,” said Michael Gove, the   justice secretary, who also compared   economists to Nazi scientists. The final lesson is that protest votes are not, in fact, a token gesture. They have a very real impact in the real world. For the next two years, as the UK negotiates its departure from the EU  —   and Scotland’s likely breakup from England  —   the protest voters will come to understand that the experts’ warnings of jobs leaving for Europe were real. Those warnings are also true across the Atlantic. If the US wants to end its status as the world’s only true superpower, it should close its borders to a billion Muslims, launch a trade war with China, build a giant wall to keep out Mexicans, and kick out 11 million residents. It won’t make America great, but it will be one hell of a protest.\n",

      "U. K. voters have decided to leave the European Union  —   a result that’s left many Brits reeling, especially young people. Social media is flooded with expressions of shock and rage as the country begins to digest what the monumental decision will mean for its economy and its future.    polls show a strong generational divide on the issue, with at least 73 percent of voters aged   wanting to remain in the EU. By contrast, only 40 percent of voters over 65 wanted to stay. It’s that divide that has provoked this backlash from young people, who accuse older generations of choosing a future that they don’t want. ”Freedom of movement was taken away by our parents, uncles and grandparents in a parting blow to a generation that was already drowning in the debts of our predecessors,” reads a comment on a Financial Times article that has been shared tens of thousands of times. As the commenter writes, ”The younger generation has lost the right to live and work in 27 other countries. We will never know the full extent of the lost opportunities, friendships, marriages and experience we will be denied.” The hashtag #WhatHaveWeDone, which is trending in the U. K. provides a stark snapshot of the rage, disgust and sadness many young Brits feel about the result. Here’s a selection of tweets: Of course, a sizable number of young people supported the move and are celebrating: The referendum result has also provoked some excellent gallows humor, poking fun at British food and at the immediate economic implications of leaving the EU. It’s also prompted the classic ”moving to Canada” reaction, with some social media users posting that they are researching other places to live. According to Google Trends, they have plenty of company. In a Guardian opinion piece, writer Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett argues that young people are right to be angry, especially the ”   who were denied the right to participate in this referendum.” Here’s more from Cosslett: ”. ..[I]f you are young and you are experiencing feelings of fury and heartbreak about the result, you are justified in doing so. The political is personal the way that the future weeks, months and years play out will have powerful, definable consequences on the way you live. This is one of those momentous turning points in our personal timelines if you’re pissed off, you are right to be.” You can find our coverage of the vote result here.\n",

      "By a   percent margin, the popular vote in the United Kingdom last night moved to detach the country from the European Union. It’s been a momentous event, building up for months with anticipation and anxiety domestically and abroad, marked by bitter campaigning, sharp regional disagreements and the murder of an  ”Brexit” member of Parliament, Jo Cox. But if you judge a country’s interests only by prevalent Google searches, it was after the polls closed when British voters started to think seriously about the implications of their choice. According to data from Google Trends, the searches for ”what is the eu” and ”what is brexit” started climbing across Britain late into the night. The polls closed at 10 p. m. local time. Though of course searches for these questions were dwarfed by the general interest in ”Brexit results,” the question ”what is the EU” spiked in popularity across all parts of the U. K. in this order: Northern Ireland, Wales, England, Scotland. Google Trends, on Twitter, has highlighted a few local spikes, too, with ”what is Brexit” a top search related to the referendum in both Northern Ireland and Scotland. Both of them voted in favor of remaining in the EU. Londoners specifically did a lot of googling for ”move to Gibraltar.” (Gibraltar is a British territory in southern Europe.) Like many in the U. K. people around the world are starting to figure out what Brexit is and what it means. Driven in large part by concerns about immigration, Britain’s unexpected decision to exit the EU won’t be settled for a few years and leaves a lot of uncertainty about the future of trade and cooperation.

      "Britain’s Prime Minister David Cameron was at his political peak just last year as he led his Conservative Party to an outright majority in Parliament for the first time in more than two decades, surpassing all the forecasts. Today, his political career is effectively over, the result of another surprise at the ballot box  —   the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union. ”This is how a political life ends: with a crash, not a whimper,” Scottish journalist Alex Massie wrote in Foreign Policy. ”David Cameron’s place in history is now assured. He is the man who took the United Kingdom out of the European Union.” Which is exactly the opposite of what Cameron intended. As part of last year’s highly successful campaign, Cameron pledged to hold a referendum on EU membership. It was a promise he didn’t have to make and didn’t really want to keep. He favors a U. K. in the family of Europe, but bowed to pressure from his own party, which includes many leading  . Cameron’s intent was to silence those critics with a vote reaffirming Britain’s commitment to the EU. But the result has put the country on the EU   and brought an abrupt end to his six years as prime minister. ”I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the European Union, and I made clear the referendum was about this and this alone  —   not the future of any single politician, including myself,” an emotional Cameron said Friday morning at 10 Downing St. the prime minister’s office. He said he would step down, though he’ll serve as a caretaker until a new prime minister is chosen by his fellow Conservatives. The aim is to have a new leader in place by the time the Conservatives hold a party conference in October, he said. Cameron had successfully navigated many potential pitfalls since becoming prime minister in 2010. He was on a winning streak and had reason to think he was on safe ground with the EU referendum. Two years ago, Cameron sanctioned a referendum on Scottish independence, and successfully campaigned for its defeat by a convincing margin. He called last year’s triumph in the parliamentary elections ”the sweetest victory of all.” While not great, Britain’s economy has been one of the better performers in underperforming Europe. And despite Britain’s mixed feelings about being tied to Europe, the U. K. has been a Euro member for more than four decades. Britain signed up in 1973, back when it was called the European Economic Community. Just two years later, the country held a referendum on leaving, yet voters chose overwhelmingly to stay by a    margin. But Cameron miscalculated this time. The two overriding issues were the economy and immigration, and they were closely linked. For the young and   working in London’s financial community, globalization has been a roaring success, filled with opportunities. For   citizens with stagnant wages, immigration and EU policies were often the scapegoat. Cameron pledged to limit immigration to fewer than 100, 000 people a year. Yet the free movement permitted under EU rules meant Cameron was in no position to stop the influx from other EU countries, which accounted for more than half of the 330, 000 in net migration to Britain last year. ”Perhaps one day, even David Cameron will be able to appreciate the irony of his downfall: the man who became Conservative leader promising to end the party’s appetite for strife over Europe has been destroyed by his decision to feed that hunger,” wrote James Kirkup in The Telegraph. ”For now though, he could be forgiven for a touch of bitterness about how cruelly political fortunes can turn.” Greg Myre is the international editor of NPR. org.

      " Global stock markets lost about $2 trillion in value on Friday after Britain voted to leave the European Union, while sterling suffered a record   plunge to a   low and money poured into   gold and government bonds. The blow to investor confidence and the uncertainty the vote sparked could keep the U. S. Federal Reserve from raising interest rates as planned this year, and even spark a new round of emergency policy easing from major central banks. The move blindsided investors, who had expected Britain to vote to stay in the EU, and sparked sharp repricing across asset classes. Mainland European equity markets took the brunt of selling as investors feared the vote could destabilize the   bloc by prompting more referendums.  The traditional   assets of   government debt, the Japanese yen and gold all jumped. Spot gold rose nearly 4 percent and the yield on the benchmark   U. S. Treasury note fell to a low of 1. 406 percent, last seen in 2012, though it climbed higher in afternoon trading.  Stocks tumbled in Europe. Frankfurt   and Paris   each fell 7 percent to 8 percent. Italian   and Spanish   markets posted their sharpest   drops ever, falling more than 12 percent, led by a dive in European bank stocks . SX7P. Italy’s Unicredit ( ) fell 24 percent while Spain’s Banco Santander ( ) fell 20 percent.  London’s FTSE   dropped 3. 2 percent, with some investors speculating that the plunge in sterling could benefit Britain’s economy. The index closed up 2 percent for the week for its best weekly gain in over two months. ”I think markets were really caught off guard today, that’s why you are seeing a huge   trade,” said Jeff Kravetz, a strategist at the Private Client Reserve at U. S. Bank. ”In the end, when markets start to settle down, I think they are going to realize that this is not the end of the world.” Still, Britain’s big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds ( ) Barclays ( ) and RBS ( ) plunging as much as 30 percent, although they cut those losses nearly in half later in the day. Stocks on Wall Street traded down more than 3 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average dropping as much as 655 points, its worst daily drop in 10 months. The Dow Jones industrial average   fell 611. 21 points, or 3. 39 percent, to 17, 399. 86, the S&P 500   lost 76. 02 points, or 3. 6 percent, to 2, 037. 3 and the Nasdaq Composite   dropped 202. 06 points, or 4. 12 percent, to 4, 707. 98. MSCI’s   world stock index . MIWD00000PUS fell 4. 8 percent. Voting results showed a 51. .1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two. The British pound dived by 18 U. S. cents at one point, to its lowest since 1985. The euro slid 3 percent to $1. 1050   as investors feared for its very future. Sterling was last down 8. 3 percent at $1. 3642   having carved out a range of $1. 3228 to $1. 5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye. The Bank of England, European Central Bank and the People’s Bank of China all said they were ready to provide liquidity if needed to ensure global market stability. SHOCKWAVES The shockwaves affected all asset classes and regions. The   yen jumped 3. 8 percent to 102. 36 per dollar   having been as low as 106. 81. The dollar’s peak decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998. Emerging market currencies across Asia and eastern Europe  and South Africa’s rand all buckled on fears that investors could pull out. Poland’s zloty   slumped 4. 7 percent. Europe’s safety play, the   German government bond, surged, with yields tumbling back into negative territory and a new record low.  MSCI’s broadest index of   shares outside Japan . MIAPJ0000PUS slid almost 3. 4 percent. Tokyo’s Nikkei   had its worst fall since 2011, down 7. 9 percent. Investors stampeded into   sovereign bonds, with U. S.   notes US10YT=RR up around 1. 5 points in price to yield 1. 5718 percent. Earlier, the yield dipped to 1. 406 percent. The rally even extended to UK bonds, despite a warning from ratings agency Standard & Poor’s that it was likely to  downgrade Britain’s   credit rating if it left the EU. Yields on benchmark   gilts fell 27 basis points to 1. 096 pct GB10YT=TWEB. Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in less chance of another hike in U. S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.

      "  TURNBERRY, Scotland  —   Arriving here Friday for his first trip abroad as the likely Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump did not seem to understand the gravity of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union. As the value of the pound collapsed in the morning and stock markets around the globe plummeted, Trump attended a surreal   at his luxury golf resort in this seacoast village and barely mentioned the global news until reporters pressed him to do so. For a candidate who has struggled to show that his grasp of foreign policy matches that of former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, Trump could have used the moment to prove his critics wrong. Instead, he staged a widely broadcast infomercial for his newest luxury property, Trump Turnberry.  He landed by helicopter, sporting a white cap bearing his presidential campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again. ” The theme was tweaked on red caps worn by resort staffers: “Make Turnberry Great Again. ” At a news conference later, Trump stood in front of a bagpiper and continued to speak after a prankster threw several dozen red golf balls bearing swastikas onto the grass.  [Donald Trump’s Brexit press conference was beyond bizarre]      Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said at a news conference June 24 that if Britain leaving the E. U. devalues the British pound, ”different places in Great Britain I think you’re going to see a lot of activity.” (Reuters)   As reporters pressed him on the referendum to leave the E. U. known as Brexit, Trump declared the vote “fantastic” and “great” because it reflected the anger of voters  —   even though Scots voted overwhelmingly to remain. He said that “the result might have been different” if President Obama had not urged Britain to remain in the E. U. And he suggested that a falling pound could benefit both the United Kingdom and his property here. “I think it’s a great thing that happened,” Trump told reporters shortly after his helicopter landed. “People are angry, all over the world. People, they’re angry. ” He added later, “When the pound goes down, more people are coming to Turnberry, frankly. For traveling and for other things, I think it very well could turn out to be a positive. ”  [Live updates: Britain votes to leave the European Union]  Trump also suggested that running a golf course was comparable to running a nation. “You’ll be amazed how similar it is,” he told reporters. “It’s a place that has to be fixed. ” Trump’s   visit to Scotland was scheduled  —   with much fanfare  —   strictly as a business trip. That could have insulated him from the kind of scrutiny that attended past   visits abroad by presidential candidates such as GOP nominee Mitt Romney and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R). Instead, strategists said, Trump’s awkward and   response to the Brexit vote left him more vulnerable to criticism from Clinton.   Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump gestures following a news conference, at his Turnberry golf course, in Turnberry, Scotland. (Clodagh  )  “This is an opportunity to showcase yourself as a world leader and as a potential commander in chief,” said Kevin Madden, a veteran GOP operative who advised the 2012 GOP nominee, Romney. “So when the images being seen back home are at a golf course, that’s a missed opportunity. ” Clinton’s chief policy adviser, Jake Sullivan, called Trump’s Scottish news conference a “spectacle” that should worry voters. He said Trump “put his golf course interest ahead” of U. S. interests and failed to understand that American households could be hurt by the Brexit vote. “Donald Trump has consistently shown disregard for our friends and allies across the world and talked about a weaker, less confident America,” Sullivan said. “Donald Trump proves again he is temperamentally unfit for the job. ” When asked if he was traveling with his foreign policy advisers or consulting them, Trump said he had been in contact with them but “there’s nothing to talk about. ”   [Trump’s top example of foreign experience: A Scottish golf course losing millions]  In answering questions, Trump repeatedly pressed the point that there were similarities between the Brexit vote and his own unexpected rise in the U. S. presidential race. “I really do see a parallel between what’s happening in the United States and what’s happening here,” Trump told reporters. “You just have to embrace it; it’s the will of the people. ” Outside the event, a couple of hundred protesters and a handful of supporters gathered along the road in front of Turnberry. The protesters chanted slogans that included “Trump go home!” and “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here!” An organizer on a megaphone belted out: “Trump always plays the racist card at all times!” While many of the protests at Trump’s political rallies in the United States have focused on his controversial comments on illegal immigrants from Mexico and Muslims, the protesters here called for compassion for refugees, who have been pouring into Europe from Syria and other   countries. Robbie Easton, 29, traveled on a bus from Glasgow to Turnberry so that he could challenge Trump’s “poisonous rhetoric. ” “Scapegoating whole religions of people, scapegoating whole populations of people fleeing war zones and destitute people, families drowning in the Mediterranean and referring to these people as cockroaches?” asked Easton, a student who voted Thursday for Britain to remain in the E. U. “I see this getting worse throughout the world. . . . It’s really quite frightening. ”  [In Scotland  —   and everywhere else  —   Trump mixes politics and profits]  Just as Trump started to speak at the news conference, he was interrupted by a man with unruly hair wearing a Turnberry sweater who made an announcement. Comedian Simon Brodkin  —   who often plays a character called Lee Nelson  —   said he forgot to pass out a new series of golf balls to guests and tossed out the red balls featuring swastikas. “Get him out,” Trump said as security surrounded Brodkin and led him away.  Trump proceeded with the news conference, still surrounded by the golf balls. In addition to the protesters, there was a handful of Trump supporters and   who gathered to watch Trump’s helicopter land on the lawn. Mike Ross, 48, wore a   featuring Trump’s face with the message: “Donald Trump, Making Ayrshire Great Again,” referring to the Scottish region where Trump opened his golf course and hotel. Ross carried a sign with the same image and slogan. “I like him. I like the way he’s changing politics and the stuffy political correctness,” Ross said. “He’s breaking all of the protocols. The leave vote was part of that.  “People are fed up. ” As Ross talked with a reporter, a protester walked by and shouted: “Are you a racist as well, man?” In addition to Turnberry, Trump is expected to visit a golf resort he owns near Aberdeen on the eastern coast. Scotland is the birthplace of his mother, who immigrated to New York as a teenager.  DelReal reported from Washington. Anne Gearan in Washington contributed to this report. \n",

      "  LONDON  —   If anyone still needed a reminder that the phrase “it can’t happen here” should be struck from the lexicon of 2016, Britain’s historic Brexit referendum provided one more dramatic piece of evidence. The question is how Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and their allies interpret the results of what did happen here. The decision by British voters to take a leap into the unknown by severing ties with the European Union is by no means a reliable predictor of the eventual outcome of the presidential election in the United States. But neither was it an event without larger meaning. Frustration with political elites knows no borders today. There are signs of it across Europe, just as there have been signs of it in the United States in recent campaign cycles. What erupted here this week is stirring elsewhere. It has defied conventional thinking and disrupted conventional analyses. Who’s to say there are no more significant shocks ahead? Here’s one example of a connection between what happened in Britain and the rise of Trump in the United States: In Britain, nearly the entire political establishment was aligned in favor of staying in the European Union. The “remain” campaign was in some measure an effort by these political elites to scare    voters with dire forecasts about what a   economy might look like that included threats of spending cuts and higher taxes. But when voters went to the polls, in a huge turnout, they either weren’t afraid of those forecasts or didn’t believe what they had heard because they had given up on the political leaders of their country. In either case, it was an explicit rejection of what they were being told and an embrace of their own instincts and personal experiences.       [Brexit vote brings swift consequences and a Cameron resignation]  How does that relate to the presidential campaign? Ask Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster who has been conducting focus groups of Republicans, Democrats and independents in this and previous campaign cycles under the auspices of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. Outside Pittsburgh last week, he assembled a group of voters who fit the model of potential supporters of Trump. The session came after Trump had experienced a series of   wounds  —   bad enough, Hart believed, to give people pause about supporting the New York billionaire. What he found instead were people who were far more forgiving than he had expected. They were willing to ignore or dismiss his gaffes, to explain away his mistakes and to focus instead on something he did that they liked. “It just shocked me,” he said. The Brexit vote is the kind of event that should make both the Clinton and Trump campaigns pause and take notice. As they began to respond Friday, it was clear that both had seized on aspects of the British result that reinforced some of their basic instincts. Clinton issued a carefully worded statement respecting the decision of the British voters to break with the E. U. while restating the importance of the   relationship between the two allies. She also said this as a way of trying to discredit her opponent: “This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans’ pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests. ”  [Continuing updates on Brexit and the fallout]    British travelers in a Paris train station have mixed reactions to the outcome of the historic referendum back home to leave the European Union. (Reuters)   Trump also touched on the close ties between the United States and Britain, but his statement highlighted themes quite different from Clinton’s, themes straight from his own message. “The people of the United Kingdom have exercised the sacred right of all free peoples,” he said. “They have declared their independence from the European Union and have voted to reassert control over their own politics, borders and economy. ” Arriving for the grand opening of his refurbished golf course in Scotland, Trump put it more bluntly. “They took their country back,” he said. “That’s a great thing. ” David Axelrod, the chief strategist in President Obama’s two campaigns, said some caution is needed in interpreting the meaning of the Brexit vote before knowing what, if anything, it means for American politics. But he cited two things of note for Clinton. “One is, if this has negative implications for the U. S. economy between now and November, that’s a bad thing” for Clinton, he said. “Two, if it creates a sense of instability, that may be a good thing [for her] in an election where there’s a great deal of concern about whether Trump is up to handling crises. ” Trump ally Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, cast the Brexit vote as an almost wholly positive outcome for the presumptive Republican nominee. “This vote is about national identity. It is about   in Brussels. It is about immigration, and it is about the right to promote your own future,” he said.  [Trump celebrates Brexit vote on trip to Scotland]  Gingrich added: “So Trump gets up this morning and says, ‘    set your own destiny, fight for your own economic future and quit letting foreigners tell you what to do.’ That’s where Brexit works for him. ” Gingrich said Clinton can’t plan to fall back on her experience or a claim to be steadier in a crisis to counter Trump’s populist appeal. He pointed to her advocacy of intervention in Libya, her call for a reset with Russia and other aspects of her tenure as secretary of state. “She has a record,” he said. “She’s not just a candidate being reinvented. ” Axelrod conceded that in an   environment, Clinton would have difficultly presenting herself as a change candidate: “At the end of the day, what she’s selling is confidence, stability, seriousness. . . . [Trump] certainly has tapped into those primal forces. The question is whether they’re strong enough to overcome serious questions about his temperament and preparedness. ”  [What Brexit says about Trump’s chances]  Conventional thinking suggests that Trump will somehow disqualify himself in the eyes of too many voters, a novice politician who doesn’t take seriously enough the role and responsibility of being a presidential nominee. But Hart said, “Obviously, if he has something to say, there’s an audience willing to listen to him. ” The parallels between Brexit and the U. S. presidential election only go so far. One is an    vote on a proposition, an idea, an action. The other involves more complicated judgments about individual candidates. Brexit was decided on the basis of a tally of the popular vote. Presidential races are decided by political geography and electoral votes. But the broader message from the Brexit vote goes beyond the economic and political turmoil it has touched off here. This is a time of political instability in which the old anchors and guideposts have been dramatically weakened. Politicians who ignore this, who think conventionally, who don’t find ways to understand and address it, will be taking foolish and unnecessary risks.

      "       The whole world is reeling after a milestone referendum in Britain to leave the European Union. And although leaders of the campaign to exit Europe are crowing over their victory, it seems many Britons may not even know what they had actually voted for. Awakening to a stock market plunge and a precipitous decline in the value of the pound that Britain hasn’t seen in more than 30 years, voters now face a series of economic shocks that analysts say will only worsen before they improve. The consequences of the leave vote will be felt worldwide, even here in the United States, and some British voters say they now regret casting a ballot in favor of Brexit.   [No, Brexit isn’t a good sign for Trump]   ”Even though I voted to leave, this morning I woke up and I just  —   the reality did actually hit me,” one woman told the news channel ITV News. ”If I’d had the opportunity to vote again, it would be to stay.”   [The critical fact Trump forgot in his viral speech on Brexit]   That confusion over what Brexit might mean for the country’s economy appears to have been reflected across the United Kingdom on Thursday. Google reported sharp upticks in searches not only related to the ballot measure but also about basic questions concerning the implications of the vote. At about 1 a. m.

      "       Today has been a day of bitterness, resentment and betrayal for British millennials like me. Overnight, my generation has lost the right to call ourselves Europeans, as well as the right to live, love and work in the 27 other countries of the European Union. Among the many divisions the referendum has revealed in the U. K. the chasm between generations is becoming the most pronounced. While the Leave campaign achieved a   victory in the referendum, 75 percent of voters between 18 and 24 wanted to remain. For all intents and purposes, the referendum result is just the latest in a series of attacks on my generation’s future. First came the financial crisis, caused by poor   on the part of baby boomers across the world. Soon after came austerity measures that disproportionately affected young people in favor of protecting British pensions. Now we are being forced from the European Union  —   against the wishes of the vast majority of young people  —   in an attack from a generation that will live to see very little of its consequences.   [How the Brexit vote represents the Americanization of British politics]   The last time Britain had a referendum on its E. U. membership, back in 1973, the parents of my generation weren’t even old enough to vote. Being European has always been a given for us; most people my age had never questioned or doubted the future of U. K. . U. relations until this referendum campaign began. And why would we? Most of us recognize that we have more in common with young people in Spain or the Netherlands than we do with the older folks who share our British nationality. There’s a natural divide between generations around the world: There are those of us who grew up with the Internet, and those whose lives go largely unaffected by anything digital or global in nature. We’ve grown up believing in a future that transcends national borders because we experience that world in our work, interests and social lives online. Today, the future we imagined was stolen from us. Over the course of a single night, baby boomers have rejected expert opinion and torn apart my generation’s future. Why? Because a vague notion of making our country “great again,” combined with an infectious hysteria about immigration, was enough to convince them that things have to change. They were so convinced, in fact, that they were happy to vote for Leave without any definition of what “great” looks like, and no road map to actually achieving it.   [The Brexit debate has made Britain more racist]   The situation becomes clearer and starker as the hours pass. Faced with the reality of Brexit, the Leave campaign has wasted no time in backtracking on their promises to restrict immigration and redirect our £350 million annual E. U. contribution to the National Health Service. Martin Schulz, president of the European Parliament, is already set on   Britain’s exit against the wishes of our divided Conservative government. Decades of uncertainty and political chaos have been unleashed by a generation of voters that barely possesses the digital literacy to use a USB stick correctly. As a result, our Parliament will spend years ignoring the tangible problems of ordinary people while they renegotiate   treaties that simply don’t need fixing. The vital resources that could deliver opportunity and prosperity for my generation will now be spent grasping for the little negotiating power the U. K. has left. The hope? That these crumbs of power can be used in a desperate battle for rapid agreement on new trade deals. Google has reported a dramatic increase in searches for Irish passport applications since the Leave result became clear this morning. If the conversations I’ve had today are anything to go by, the next big decision for baby boomers will be how to pay for their pensions when my generation pack up their bags to abandon the sinking ship that the U. K. has just become.\n",

      " With Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, did Donald Trump just win the presidential election? On the surface, this may seem an odd question, but the concerns that led a majority of Brits to vote “leave” on Thursday are similar to those that have catapulted Trump to the Republican nomination  —   immigration, refugees, underemployment.  Also similar have been reactions to Brexit and to Trump’s political rise. Analysts and market speculators were shocked that the prediction models they used were wrong. Overnight, the political playbook seemed to have become a relic of some distant past.  The biggest gambler of all was Prime Minister David Cameron, who held the referendum despite his preference to “remain. ” His resignation essentially marked the death of the establishment and a rebirth of people who have risen in protest of a world they refuse to accept.  The populist,   movement we’ve been witnessing in the United States isn’t purely local. Other countries, especially in Europe, are feeling similar stresses to their psyche as well as their material infrastructure, leading to renewed calls for nationalism. Already, other nations are queuing up to join merry old England on the exit ramp.    Here are three big ways that Britain leaving the E. U. might affect Americans. (Daron Taylor, Jhaan   Washington Post)   The ground has shifted and, with it, global markets. Immediately, the pound plunged along with stock values. Rattled investors tried to regain their equilibrium. The world gaped in breathless wonderment as a new,   landscape took shape. All, that is, except for Donald Trump. Conveniently in Scotland to visit his Turnberry resort, the   baron of bombast opined that Brexit was “a great thing. ” Never mind that the “Scotch,” as Trump recently referred to his Scots heritage, voted overwhelmingly to remain in the E. U. and likely will hold a referendum soon to separate from Britain. What matters is that Trump saw in Brexit an opportunity to profit. Because that’s what Trump does. One impoverished fellow’s home foreclosure is Trump’s business opportunity. One nation’s lost cause is his tourist bonanza.  You probably thought Brexit was about national independence, didn’t you? Trump thought it was about him. The pound’s decline, he explained, could mean more travelers to his resorts  —   and what could be better than that?  Trump further explained that it was great the British people were taking their country back, just as Trump supporters are hoping to do in November. Indeed, in many respects, Trump is the U. S.’s “Trexit”  —   a ticket to leave the establishment and entrenched bureaucrats whom Trump’s admirers, and Britain’s leavers, see as responsible for their respective nation’s problems.  This message, though we’ve heard it a thousand times, has taken time to penetrate the minds of commentators and analysts who now humbly acknowledge that they didn’t see “it” coming  —   neither Brexit nor Trump. It was easier to name the manifestations  —   xenophobia, racism, sexism, “fear of the other”  —   than it was to recognize the root causes, which, distilled, amount to a looming sense of lost identity.              Caption   Many celebrated the referendum results Friday and British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that he will resign after Britons went to the polls the day before.

      " WHAT NOW for Europe? After Britain’s vote to exit the European Union, European leaders will be tempted to keep the rest of the E. U. together by making an example of the continent’s   economy. In fact, insisting that Britain’s exit be unnecessarily difficult would lead to more economic pain for all.  Start by remembering why a generation of leaders built organizations such as the E. U.   have come together in international institutions to make their conduct regular and predictable, which promotes the free flow of goods, money, people and ideas and the   that follows. Over the past 70 years, these institutions have been remarkably successful, keeping the peace in much of the world and setting conditions for an unprecedented growth in prosperity. But such institutions are always imperfect, because it is exceptionally difficult to get independent countries to agree on common rules. They are always subject to exaggerated criticism, because the benefits of cooperation inevitably require some surrender of sovereign control. It takes brave leadership, of the sort Prime Minister David Cameron lacked when he agreed to hold a referendum, to explain the benefits and defend against demagogic attacks on the hated “status quo” or shadowy “elites. ” Now, if leadership continues to be lacking, we may learn that such institutions are far easier to dismantle than they are to build. Scotland and Northern Ireland, where majorities voted to stay in Europe, may decide to leave the United Kingdom. Other restive provinces in Europe (such as Catalonia) will seek to break up other nations. Meanwhile, France, the Netherlands and other countries will debate following Britain out of the E. U. Can all this be accomplished cheerfully, with a happy nod to returning democratic control closer to the people and no price to pay? Possibly. But anyone passingly familiar with European history of the past century knows that, when relations between even seemingly enlightened countries breach, very dark forces can take control. Some voters Thursday may have been motivated by a carefully researched resentment of   regulations, but others were moved by more emotional fears of refugees and other foreigners. Unscrupulous leaders are exploiting similar anxieties from France to Poland and in between.     Managing the U. K.’s demand for a divorce will be a complex task, with implications for the whole world economy. Whoever leads Britain after Mr. Cameron must strive to keep the country as interconnected with Europe as possible, following the model of Norway or Switzerland. Europe, in turn, must resist the understandable urge to punish a country that has just spurned it, and allow a graceful exit. Europe has tried the alternative path of unrestrained nationalism, escalating rounds of retributive economic policy and the autarkic misery that resulted.  Donald Trump’s   railings against “stupid” trade deals and   allies echo the appeal to voters’ suspicions that prevailed in Britain. Brexit’s success should offer one more argument against complacency to those who fear Mr. Trump’s appeals to bigotry. But no precise analogies can be drawn between Europe and the United States, nor between Mr. Trump and the Brexiteers. Americans still have an opportunity to make their own decisions and write their own history.   Read more about this topic:   Anne Applebaum: Britain’s decision to leave the E.

      "     Donald Trump’s supporters were invigorated Friday by the shocking news that British voters opted to leave the European Union. They even called on American voters to follow Britain’s lead and elect Trump  —   who has said “America First” will be the “major, overriding theme of my administration”  —   as their president in November. “The failed European Union experiment, and Great Britain’s rejection of it, must serve as a   call for all of us in America,” said Sen. Jeff Sessions ( .) the first senator to endorse Trump. “I believe the American people too will choose independence this November. ” The surprising victory of the “Leave” campaign demonstrated the power of populism in a dissatisfied electorate. Trump has capitalized on a similar force in the U. S. using it to knock out more   competition in the GOP primary and counting on it to drive supporters to the polls in November.   [Britain’s shock vote brings global consequences as leader resigns, markets plunge]   “I really do see a parallel between what’s happening in the United States and what’s happening here,” Trump said Friday in a press conference in Scotland. “You’re going have this happen more and more  …    It’s happening by the fact that I’ve done so well in the polls. ” [Trump’s Brexit news conference was beyond bizarre] Electoral college math suggests Trump will have a harder time winning the White House than “Leave” voters had winning a close referendum. But some members of Congress warn the “elite” should not discount the demands of disgruntled voters. “The result of this referendum should remind leaders in Washington, London, Brussels and across Europe that our citizens are dissatisfied with stagnant economies, declining wages, uncontrolled migration, rising crime and terror attacks at home,” said Sen. Tom Cotton ( .) who has advised Trump on a few occasions and has not ruled out serving in his administration. Some congressional Democrats suggested the Brexit vote is a cautionary example the U. S. should avoid repeating. Senate Foreign Relations Committee senior Democrat Ben Cardin (Md.) said he was “disappointed by the outcome of the referendum,” particularly when the U. S. and Europe must present a united front against a resurgent Russia and terrorist threats from the Islamic State. “This act of   instability was fueled, in no small part, by the   isolationist populism we’re seeing on the rise throughout the world and even here at home,” House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer ( .) said in a statement Friday. The Brexit vote had an   allure that gripped even Republicans who say Trump “scares” them. “The decision by the British people to leave the EU is a rejection of centralized power and unaccountable bureaucracy, a sentiment widely shared by many Americans,” said Sen. Mike Lee ( ) in a statement. “Now more than ever we must respect the will of their people. ” For members of Congress, Britain’s decision to part ways with the E. U. is not just a chance to draw political parallels between old allies. There is a clear role for Congress to play in the U. S. response: Washington and London now have to strike a new free trade agreement, and Congress has to approve it. Cotton stressed the Obama administration should start negotiating a   agreement with the U. K. “now,” while Lee said he would introduce legislation to let the U. S. and U. K. operate in the spirit of current arrangements “until new bilateral agreements can be negotiated. ” Economic cooperation has traditionally been a major part of U. S. . K. relations, and House Speaker Paul Ryan ( .) is a champion of free trade, arguing in the House GOP’s national security strategy that trade can “play a key role in strengthening U. S. alliances. ”   [Paul Ryan lays out national security agenda, softening Trump’s edges]   But free trade has taken political hits recently, as lawmakers bitterly divide over the   Partnership,  a massive agreement that Congress may vote on after the election.   [McConnell warns that trade deal can’t pass Congress before 2016 elections]   Some lawmakers are using Brexit as an excuse to rail against TPP again and warn against all international partnerships. “We must remember that the European Union began as a seemingly benign economic agreement,” Sessions said, adding that Clinton promoted the TPP as “the gold standard” of trade deals as part of her “globalist agenda. ”   [Jeff Sessions is Donald Trump’s biggest fan. Here’s how their relationship began.]   TPP isn’t the only “globalist” arrangement Trump and his supporters have taken shots at. Trump himself has been dismissive of the United Nations and called NATO “obsolete. ” Republican leaders have rushed to soften his message. The House GOP’s national security blueprint stressed NATO countries should spend more on defense so the organization would not “fall into disrepair, or worse, irrelevance. ” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker ( .) expressed similar sentiments this week. But both Corker and Ryan were exceedingly measured Friday in their response to the U. K.’s decision to leave the E. U. “A free people should choose their own way, and we respect the British decision to leave the European Union,” Corker said in a statement, urging focus on bilateral trade and security cooperation, and adding the U. S. . K. “close partnership will endure. ” “I respect the decision made by the people of the United Kingdom,” Ryan said, calling the U. K. “an indispensable ally” and ensuring “that special relationship is unaffected by this vote. ”\n",

      "       EDINBURGH, Scotland  —   Friday, as it turned out, was an appropriate moment for Donald Trump to arrive in the United Kingdom. “Come November, the American people will have the chance to   their independence,” the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said in a statement issued as he landed to visit his golf course at Turnberry. “I hope America is watching, it will soon be time to believe in America again. ” The implication was clear: Where Britain led this past week, the United States might follow in November. But that gets it backward. This people’s revolt represented, in many respects, the Americanization of British politics. The “leave” campaign’s slogan  —   its devastatingly effective slogan  —   of “take back control” was positively Trumpian. Indeed, some of the same forces of alienation, discontent, economic insecurity and racial animosity that produced Trump in the United States have now hauled Britain out of the European Union. This past week’s revolution, arguably the greatest political insurrection since the dawn of the democratic era, offers further evidence that some political trends recognize no borders or boundaries. It was more than just a political battle; it was a culture war, too. And it bore the hallmarks of the one that began in the United States 50 years ago. The campaign, at its crudest, pitted the “people” against the “establishment,” the powerless against the powerful. The “leave” side cast itself as a guerrilla insurgency against a complacent and    governing elite. Like recent U. S. campaigns, this one was marked by a distaste for experts. There were shades of Barry Goldwater and the United States’ 2010 tea party wave in this; shades, perhaps, of the Reagan revolution, too. Brexit might break everything, the thinking went, but unless things are broken, nothing can change. This is Year Zero now. The referendum laid bare the fault lines in British society, and they turn out to be as stark as the divisions between red and blue America. Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay in Europe; England and Wales opted out. Within England, London  —   cosmopolitan, liberal, wealthy  —   voted for the status quo, but rural areas, from the sleepy shires to the rusting   towns of the north, chose to leave. In doing so, they revolted against more than just Brussels and the institutions of the E. U.; they delivered an   rebuke to London and Westminster (as Parliament is known) too. Only a quarter of members of Parliament came out for Brexit: The gap between the people and their representatives has never before, at least on an issue of this significance, been so wide. You do not speak for us, voters said, and we hold you in some contempt for your failure to represent, or even understand, our concerns. G. K. Chesterton’s lines seem hauntingly appropriate: “Smile at us, pay us, pass us; but do not quite   we are the people of England, that never have spoken yet. ” Now the people have spoken, and the whole world has heard their roar.   [British millennials like me are the real losers in the Brexit vote]   As the GOP establishment has discovered in this U. S. election cycle, a hurricane of contemptuous discontent demolishes everything in its path. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, had warned against the destabilizing effect of Brexit. But as far as many voters were concerned, he was a   member of the establishment tasked with issuing such warnings. The louder the alarm, the more likely it was to be disregarded: Treasury’s estimate that, by 2030, Brexit would cost every British household 4, 300 pounds (or $5, 700) for instance, was widely derided as mere propaganda. The Bank of England, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank also agreed that Brexit would cost Britain dearly in terms of jobs and treasure. But expertise, it turned out, was part of the “remain” campaign’s problem, not its strength. Americans would have found the campaign  —   with its claims of media bias and “rigged” systems  —   perfectly familiar. Opinion polls suggested that “leave” voters didn’t trust politicians, economists, academics, foreign leaders or, indeed, anyone or anything else. Voters trusted their gut, and that was enough. William F. Buckley’s claim that he’d rather be governed by the first 2, 000 names in the Boston telephone directory than by the Harvard faculty received a glowing endorsement in Britain on Thursday. After all, it was experts who crashed the world economy in 2008, and it was experts who said very few Poles or Romanians would move to Britain once their countries were admitted to the E. U. In 2004, Tony Blair’s government estimated that just 13, 000 Poles would move to Britain seeking work; a decade later, about 600, 000 had done so. Prime Minister David Cameron once promised to cut net migration to less than 100, 000 people a year. It is a target that has been missed every year. Between March 2014 and March 2015, more than 330, 000 immigrants arrived in Britain. In the vote, geographical polarization paled beside Britain’s class divide. In American terms,   voters endorsed “remain,” and   voters opted for “leave. ” Those with the most to lose from future economic turmoil backed the government’s case; those whose lives are already freighted with economic uncertainty, like Americans in the same position, felt they had little to lose from irrevocable change. Among the middle and   class, 57 percent voted to remain; 64 percent of   voters opted to leave. Economic insecurity in places such as Lincolnshire and northeastern England trumped all other concerns. Mirroring the American experience, some of England’s   communities delivered the strongest protest votes against globalization, immigration and the economic doctrine that there is no alternative.   [The Brexit debate has made Britain more racist]   Nativism and hostility to untrammeled immigration played their part in stripping the bark from Cameron, but there was more to this English revolution than that. The winds of populism are sweeping across the Western world, and there was little reason to suppose that even an ancient and stable democracy such as Britain would develop an immunity to this pandemic. The    populism that in large part inspired the “leave” vote was instinctively nativist and sometimes at least borderline racist. But above all, it was rooted in the suspicion that something, somewhere, had gone badly wrong in British society and politics. If there are echoes of Trump here, there are also echoes of the tea party and, at least on the disillusioned left, the Occupy movement. Immigration, however, remained the touchstone issue. “Leave” promoted the lie that Turkey is on the brink of joining the E. U. conjuring the specter of a Turkish invasion, the better with which to encourage voters to “take back control. ” Only a “free” country could protect its borders  —   and it would need a bigger wall than just the English Channel. And what of the E. U. itself? In recent elections, populist parties on the right have made significant gains in Sweden, Finland, Austria and Hungary, while   populists have overthrown the established order in Greece and Spain. The continent is in a state of bubbling insurrection, and nothing Brussels  —   or Angela Merkel  —   does seems likely to quell the discontent. Indeed, past experience suggests that the European hierarchy in Brussels will be tempted to dismiss this repudiation as nothing more than a flesh wound. That’s wishful thinking; other countries are also likely to rethink their relationship with Brussels. Suddenly the prospect of a nativist President Marine Le Pen in France seems more plausible than it did just a few days ago. As acts of lacerating   go, this vote has few rivals in recent memory. A referendum is forever; there is no   and no consolation that in four years’ time there will be a fresh chance to put matters right. But it is also a reminder that voters are not always motivated by rational calculations of  . The quiet people of England have made their voice heard. We are the little people of England, they said, and who dares meddle with us? Americans would do best to remember their cry this fall. Read more: The real reason Trump is winning?

      "   Amy Studdart is a fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.    On Thursday, 52 percent of my British compatriots voted to leave the European Union. Politicians and pundits seemed shocked by the result, which caused markets to tumble and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job. But the U. K.’s international ambivalence didn’t come out of the blue; it was built on decades of fears and fissures. Here are some great books, a   political drama and some really rubbish TV to help you better understand Europe and Britain’s role within it.   “Jean Monnet: The First Statesman of Interdependence,” by François Duchêne   The founding father of the European project, Monnet was simultaneously French, British and American. Throughout the two world wars, he led the charge for a more collaborative approach among the world’s democratic leaders. In the aftermath, he traded on his contacts, reputation and intellect to build a European community that could secure permanent peace. Duchêne’s biography of Monnet is a masterpiece as relevant to America as it is to Europe.   “This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe From Churchill to Blair,” by Hugo Young   Britain and its leaders have long struggled with the country’s European identity. Do we have a closer affinity with America and the Anglosphere, or with France, Germany and Italy? How do we balance the pride at having been the world’s superpower with being one among equals in the European project? Those questions have never definitively been answered, leaving Britain to lurch back and forth in its commitment to the E. U. “This Blessed Plot,” written after the launch of the euro, traces this history from Winston Churchill through Tony Blair.  “Borgen”  “Borgen” is the European equivalent of “House of Cards. ” The show, which chronicles the rise of a fictional prime minister of Denmark, pulls off an incredible feat: It turns coalition building and compromise into political drama. Reportedly inspired by the current Danish commissioner in Brussels, Margrethe Vestager (well known in Silicon Valley for leading the E. U. crackdowns on Google and Apple) “Borgen” is a compelling snapshot of the art of modern European politics.   “European Spring,” Philippe Legrain   Even many fervent Europeanists believe that the European Union is a flawed attempt at realizing a worthwhile idea. The   and sloganeering around the British referendum have detracted from the more substantive debate over whether the E. U. lives up to its own ideals. Legrain is a controversial figure in Brussels, having been unceremoniously banished from the corridors of the European Commission after one too many fights with his colleagues. Nonetheless, this book about Brussels’s response to the euro crisis is as   a critique of E. U.   and its impact on European citizens as you are likely to find.   Eurovision Song Contest,   as hosted by Terry Wogan   Break out your cheapest vodka, gather your closest friends, and turn up the volume. If you really want to understand Europe (and Britain’s place within it) there’s no better place to start than this competition hosted by British national hero Terry Wogan. Imagine that your entire extended family gets together once a year to sing karaoke. At the end you vote, more on the basis of   grudges and   than anything to do with one another’s musical gifts. That’s Eurovision. The last time we Brits won, back in 1997, Sir Terry was disappointed, as was the rest of the United Kingdom: “That’s the whole point of it, of course, to sneer at the foreigners. ” To win was to have cared, and we’re above that.
