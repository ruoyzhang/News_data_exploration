# temporally aligned W2V
### This repository contains codes currently under construction
The aim of the project is to provide a tool for training adjacently aligned word2vec embeddings for temporal text data (news, tweets, etc)

#### Classes:
- preprocessing.py
- train.py
- model.py
- training_data_generation.py
- neighbourhood.py


#### Example codes can be found at: adjacent_training_trial.py
