# temporally aligned W2V
### This repository contains codes currently under construction
The aim of the project is to provide a tool for training temporally aligned word2vec embeddings for temporal text data (news, tweets, etc) so that stable continous visualisation can be produced to track the semantic evolution of words of interest.

#### Classes:
- preprocessing.py
- train.py
- model.py
- training_data_generation.py
- neighbourhood.py


#### Example codes of how to run the scripts can be found at: preprocess_signal.py
