# temporally aligned W2V
### This repository contains codes currently under construction
The aim of the project is to provide a tool for training adjacently aligned word2vec embeddings for temporal text data (news, tweets, etc) so that visually stable continous visualisation can be produced to track the semantic evolution of particular words of interest.

#### Classes:
- preprocessing.py
- train.py
- model.py
- training_data_generation.py
- neighbourhood.py


#### Example codes can be found at: adjacent_training_trial.py
https://github.com/ruoyzhang/temporally_aligned_W2V/blob/master/adjacent_training_trial.py

#### Example of visualisation coming soon
